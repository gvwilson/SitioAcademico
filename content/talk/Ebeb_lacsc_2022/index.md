title: "What Everyone In Data Science Should Know About Teaching And Learning "
subtitle: "Keynote"
excerpt: "Data scientists, programmers, statisticians are constantly learning new and rapidly evolving technologies. They often find themselves in a teaching role, either as mentors, generating tutorials, writing blog posts, giving talks, or even teaching more formally at universities or boot camps, without being formally prepared for that role. In this talk, we will review practical, evidence-based strategies for organizing and designing your lessons and materials, explaining concepts at the level of your students, using relevant examples, checking understanding, and connecting with students so that you can be more effective the next time you find yourself in a teaching position."
