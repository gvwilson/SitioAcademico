The second session will take place on 27 April where we will be considering Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) and facilitation. We will start the session with a panel discussion (please submit any questions here) followed by a breakout session to discuss the topics in more depth. Some of the issues we will be covering include:

-Clear understanding of your role as a facilitator;
-Vocabulary to address issues of equity and inclusion;
-Skills, strategies, and practice on how to create an inclusive environment;
-Strategies to assess and de-escalate tensions around issues of difference.

Come ready to learn from our speakers, and to share some of your own thoughts on the role of community managers as facilitators in creating a scientific research ecosystem that is equitable and co-created.
