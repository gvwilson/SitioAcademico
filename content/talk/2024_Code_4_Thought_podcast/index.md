Yanina Bellini Saibene Saibene is well known in the R (rOpenSci, R Ladies, Latin R) and The Carpentries (where she is the Vice President). She is passionate about making computing resources and teaching materials accessible to people, whose first language isn't English.
I had the pleasure of meeting Yanina for an interview where she explains how localising materials and software is essential if we want to break down barriers.
