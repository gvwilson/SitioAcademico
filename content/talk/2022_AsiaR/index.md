title: "Building inclusive communities."
subtitle: "Invited Panel"
excerpt: "The idea of the panel was to share the experience of the growth of the R community in Latin America, so I made a time line with the last 5 years rescuing the most important milestones (of which I have been part as an organizer, as an assistant or enjoying them as a member of the community)."
