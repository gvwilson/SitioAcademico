title: "Reproducible Open Science by and for All"
excerpt: "Over the last decade, rOpenSci has been a unique and impactful force in bringing rigor, integrity, reproducibility, openness, and diversity to scientific computing. We lead a set of interrelated activities around capacity building, community development, and research software development practices to transform science through open data, software & reproducibility. We will share examples of the metrics and tools we use in our main projects (Software Stats Peer Review, R-Universe, Champions Program, Multilingual Publishing, and Users and Maintainers Community) to register and understand their impact on four levels (individual, host institution/local community, rOpenSci, and the Open Science Community in general)."
