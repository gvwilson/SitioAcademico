In 2022, there exists what sometimes feels like an overwhelming array of technologies, frameworks, and shiny new products all promising to make your event run better. But what works for some events and communities may not be ideal for yours. How do you determine which technology platforms and services align with your community’s needs and values? 

In this seminar, we will practice developing and assessing the infrastructures used to organize and host events to ensure that the principles and values of accessibility and inclusivity are built into all aspects of event organizing, from conceptualization to post-event assessment. We will hear from a diverse group of event organizers who recognize that technologies have politics; concepts and discourses frame participant perspectives and actions; and as event organizers we need to carefully take heed of the frameworks and tools we use. Our speakers have first-hand experience developing the event infrastructure that have helped them successfully hold space for diverse participants and topics of conversation.

## Format
Opening presentation by [Professor Michelle Murphy](https://michellemurphy.net/), historian of technoscience and 2021 Program Chair for the largest virtual gathering of the [Society for the Social Studies of Science annual meeting](https://www.4sonline.org/meeting/past-meetings/4s-2021-toronto/). Murphy will present a framework for understanding what tools/techniques/framing devices will be appropriate for the context of a particular event community.

## Panel
Panelist (Yanina Bellini Saibene) on taking language diversity into account in an international conference; language translation
Panelist ([Kelsey Breseman](http://ifoundthemeaningoflife.com/)) on developing and applying guidelines for community participation
