This year useR! (https://user2021.r-project.org/) will be a global and entirely remote conference. One of the main goals is to encourage the participation of diverse people (considering diversity in all its forms and all its intersectionalities). The useR! global team is committed to providing inclusive and accessible spaces during the conference, along with extensive waivers, events in different languages (English, Spanish, and French), real-time English captions, and events across different time zones.

In this meetup, you will have the opportunity to meet RLadies+ from all over the globe. Our panelists will share their useR! experiences to inspire people with different backgrounds, occupations, and paths to participate in this year’s conference. The meetup will be trilingual with a few spots per organizing chapter.
