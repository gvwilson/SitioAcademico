## Appsilon Shiny Conference

<img src='featured.jpg' align="right" height="200" alt='Logo CSV Conf.'/>

The Appsilon Shiny Conference is a virtual conference hosted by Appsilon with support from Posit PBC. The conference will feature speakers from Appsilon, Posit, and YOU - members of the R Shiny community.

Registration is FREE and the Call for Papers is live. Reserve your spot today and submit your Shiny talk! Submisions are welcome from individuals and businesses - apps do not need to be publicly available. 

I was part of the organizers committee, advising about conference platforms, accesibility and multilingual content.
