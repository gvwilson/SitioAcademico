> Update: In November 2019 I toke a [course about how to teach technology](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY) as a part of the [RStudioâ€™s instructor training class](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/). In these course I learn a lot of [interesting concepts](http://teachtogether.tech/) of simple implementation to improve my courses: from the [lessons design](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:process), the [lessons delivering](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:process) and te way to [test them](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:exercises). 

> Based on these new concepts, I am adding information to my courses about [Learner Personas](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:process-personas) and [Concept Maps](http://teachtogether.tech/#s: memory-concept-maps), with the objective of making easier to determine wich is the public for the course and what topics it intends to address. This information should help in the decision to use the materials, to take the course and/or to use it in order to generate your own.
