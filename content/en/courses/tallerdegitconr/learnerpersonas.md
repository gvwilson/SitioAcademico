## Learner Personas: Who are you?

[Learner Personas](http://teachtogether.tech/#s:process-personas) describe the audience for whom the course was intended. This information should help in the decision to use the materials to take the course or to use them to generating your own.

Each lesson must be thought, organized and generated for a particular audience, this is the person we think of when we prepare this workshop:

**Romina** works by wrangling and analyzing data using R for a variety of clients.
She use projects in RStudio to organize her work. She share her progress and results using cloud tools (such as dropbox and google drive).
Sharing this way has brought her several headaches. She know that Git can help her with these problems, but it is not clear how. She has a GitHub user but never used.
She want to understand how git works and how to use it with R and RStudio so that she can incorporate it into her projects.
