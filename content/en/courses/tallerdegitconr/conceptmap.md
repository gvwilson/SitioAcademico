## What are we going to cover in this workshop?

This concept map presents the content of this workshop:

   {{< figure src="/img/git_concept_map_en.png" alt="Concept Map: The concept map presents the concepts that will be covered during the meetup. These concepts are presented in boxes or circles as nouns and the relationships between them by arrows with verbs. In our case, the concept map shows how Git works: on your computer you have RStudio IDE and an RStudio project, with a working directory, which will be the local Git repository, to which we can add files to the Staging area, from which we can commit to the local repository. From this local repository we can Push and Pull to the remote repository that can be on GitHub. This same configuration is on the machine of all collaborators.">}}
