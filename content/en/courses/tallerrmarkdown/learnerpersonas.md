## Learner Personas

The [Learner Personas] (http://teachtogether.tech/#s:process-personas) describe the audience for whom the course was intended. This information should help in the development of the lessons, how to present and disseminate the course and in the decision to use the materials, both to take the course, and/or to use them in order to generate your own.

_Antonia_ is an accountant working in a Bank.  She is young (30-45 years old).  She works with many different data sources and has a lot of experience using Excel and Word. She know some basic SQL. She needs to be able to join and analyze these various data sources and generate reports for her team and her bosses.  She never used R. She canâ€™t go to workshop in work time (7.00 am to 13.00 pm), and she is a mother so need to finish before children get out of school.  She is very busy and with high demand, so an intensive workshop outside her workplace is the best option for Antonia.
