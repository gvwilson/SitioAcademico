One of the main goals of useR! 2021 edition was to have a global reach and increase the participation of people from regions and countries that generally have a minor participation in the conference.

In this blog post we show you how the Latin American participation was from the point of view of people from the region.

## Data, data and more data

As we are data people, let's first take a look at some general data. Of the more than 1800 people who participated in the conference _221 (12%)_ identified their origin in _16 (13%)_ Latin American countries.


<br>
<p align="center">

      />
</p>
<br>

Of those 16 countries, _Brazil and Argentina_ were the ones with the highest percentage of participation, placing them in the __top 10__ of the countries with the highest participation in useR! 2021 overall.

_Complete list of Latin American countries sort by number of participants_


1. Brazil: 62 (28.0%)  
2. Argentina: 42 (19.0%) 
3. Costa Rica: 18 (8.1%) 
4. Mexico: 18 (8.1%) 
5. Colombia: 16 (7.2%) 
6. Peru: 14 (6.3%) 
7. Ecuador: 12 (5.4%) 
8. Bolivia: 7 (3.1%)  
9. Chile: 7 (3.1%)  
10. El Salvador: 7 (3.1%) 
11. Guatemala: 4 (1.8%) 
12. Uruguay: 4 (1.8%)  
13. Venezuela: 4 (1.8%)  
14. Nicaragua: 3 (1.3%)  
15. Paraguay: 2 (0.9%) 
16. Dominican Republic: 1 (0.4%)


<br> 
In useR! 2021 edition there was a high participation of Latin American, but was there really an increase in participation? To answer this question we analyzed how many people and from which Latin American countries have participated in previous editions.
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/bar_chart_latines.svg"
     alt="Bar chart showing thw number of 6 last edition. The 2021 edition sevenfold the number of registered people from latinamerica when compared with the previws one"
      />
</p>
<br>

This edition was _exceptional in terms of participation_ for Latin America. Not only did the number of Latin American attendees increased _sevenfold_, but this was the first time people from _Bolivia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Paraguay and the Dominican Republic_ participated. Brazil is the country that has participated in the most editions of useR over the years. Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Uruguay and Chile also participated in at least 3 editions. Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru and Venezuela participated for the second time.
The increase in the number of participants from Latin America in the 2021 edition is remarkable. 

Another aspect to highlight was the high participation of Latin American students. Of the total number of participants, _48% were students_ at different levels, 32% belonged to academia, 15% to industry and 5% were people who presented papers or played roles in the organization of the conference.

## Content

Latin America was represented with leading roles in the terms of content. In this edition, content was accepted in English, _Spanish_ and _French_ aiming to reduce the language barrier for access to knowledge.

Of the 5% of Latin Americans who presented papers, 39% presented an elevator pitch, 21% a regular talk, 21% a tutorial and 19% a keynote. 
  
We have to continue working to increase this 5% participation.  Initiatives such as the R-Ladies reviewers network and the #ClinicaDeCharlas channel in the LatinR Slack are spaces for people to write their abstracts and get feedback before sending it to the conference.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Entre no nosso slack! <a href="https://t.co/oZE9UQtzeS">https://t.co/oZE9UQtzeS</a><br><br>No canal <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clinicadecharlas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#clinicadecharlas</a> as pessoas da comunidade ir√£o fornecer feedbacks informais nos resumos para serem submetidos para a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/useR2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#useR2021</a> üëá <a href="https://t.co/uJqpDF6w77">https://t.co/uJqpDF6w77</a></p>&mdash; LatinR (@LatinR_Conf) <a href="https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf/status/1363528537492381698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

These spaces comprise a valuable support system for the Latin American community since we review each other‚Äôs our work prior to submission, increasing the chances of being accepted.  They also allow us to connect with people working on similar topics and generate collaborations.

Further dissemination through other channels such as email to universities and professional associations could increase the reach of the conference.

Now let's see in detail the Latin contributions by type of content.

### Keynote

For the first time at the conference a Keynote was conducted in a language other than English. _Paola Corrales, Elio Campitelli and Ivan Poggio_ presented in Spanish the talk _Teaching to teach without losing anyone along the way_ representing [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/)

## Organizing team

The organizing team for useR! 2021 was composed by more than __80 people from four continents__ and __33 of them were Latin American!__  The roles were diverse and spanned all levels of the organization: from global coordinators, leaders and members of the different teams (diversity, code of conduct, technology, communication, sponsor relations, graphic design, illustration), to session and keynotes chairs, virtual space assistants (maRmots) as well as zoom, voiceover and video editing. 

They were also part of the program committee reviewing tutorials, abstracts and being part of the awards jury. __Fourteen people__ from the region fulfilled this task out of a total of __60 members__ from around the world.

This is a list of the [full organizing team](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/), this of the [program committee](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/program-committee/) and this of the [team of facilitators who joined the team during the weeks leading up to and during the conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/ongoing_conf_team/).

## To be part

In this edition, __a diverse organizing team enriched the organization__, bringing  new perspectives and regional realities to the organizing committee that allowed __generating strategies focused on facilitating and encouraging the participation in the conference of more people around the world__. 

Among these measures we can mention the _addition of two more languages to English_ (official language of the conference) _for the presentation of your content_ (abstract or tutorial) in case it was accepted. This allowed us to have content in Spanish, one of the main languages in Latin America. We were able to present in our language and learn what was going on in our language, since the social media communication was also in Spanish. These actions reduce one of the most important barriers to participate and take advantage of these events, the language barrier.

<br>
Having _prices that were adapted to the country where we live, to our work situation and the possibility of having a complete exemption of payment_ also helped to increase participation from all over the world, including our region.

<br>
The fact that there are _people from the region in the organization with decision-making roles_ shows that there is regional talent to perform these tasks with the necessary quality and opens doors for more people to participate.  

The _virtual modality_ also helped people from different regions to participate for the first time, the costs and processes of visas, tickets and stay disappear. In case your infrastructure or your time could be an impediment to participate, the organization generated a _financial assistance program_ to, for example, hire a better internet connection or pay for care tasks during the conference, among other possibilities.

<br>

These measures not only sought to increase the participation of people from different countries around the world, but also to promote the accessibility of the conference. Accessibility actions were central to this edition, some of them were: _accessibility guides for tutorials and presentations, selection of a light infrastructure with respect to connection and computers resources, technology screen readers friendly, and subtitles in the presentations, in more than one language_.

Finally, a team committed to generating a safe and friendly environment through a _Code of Conduct, events for first-time participants, community-specific events and the friendly faces program to accompany those who are starting out in the R world_, were measures that also helped to generate an environment where people could participate and feel part of this __gReat community__.

<br>

As summarized in this article, this edition of the conference took many steps to facilitate and encourage the participation of people from Latin America, and the numbers show that participation increased considerably. We hope to continue to encourage and increase these numbers in future editions.
