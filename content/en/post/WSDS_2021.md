On October 7 I participated in a panel called ["R-Ladies: Building, Growing, and Sustaining a Community "](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/wsds/2021/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?AbstractID=310003) at the Women in Statistics and Data Science conference. 

The abtract for the panel said

> The mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. Over the last nine years, R-Ladies has grown from a single meetup to a major global organization with 206 chapters in 58 countries and 93,000 members.. Building, growing, and sustaining this community takes significant and coordinated volunteer contributions from many real humans. This panel will feature globally distributed members of the R-Ladies Global team as well as chapter organizers. The panel will discuss the various R-Ladies initiatives that are currently active or in planning stages, reflect on lessons learned and challenges faced, as well as share success stories. 


I shared the live panel with [Shel Kariuki](https://twitter.com/Shel_Kariuki), [Mouna Belaid](https://twitter.com/mounaa_belaid), [Athanasia Mowinckel](https://twitter.com/DrMowinckels) y Katherine Simeon. [Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](https://twitter.com/minebocek) led and moderate the panel.

Shel start the panel presenting [Starting and building a community all within the pandemic period](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hYcqYq6FT-WlhJpErokojw86__pVg3zaSuYZyNYrjV4/edit#slide=id.gf6c564ac77_0_224) then Mouna Belaid talk about [How to Explore your Community Management Skills into Your Professional Career](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XZGIS7u9BS9xrk_wK-A3aC3ksgbhOgre/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104555579578156232607&rtpof=true&sd=true).  Athanasia Mowinckel let us know how was to [Build resources for an international organisation](https://athanasiamo.github.io/talks/slides/2021.10.07-wids-rladies-panel/#1) and Katherine Simeon share insight about [Building an online community with @WeAreRLadies](https://guide.rladies.org/rocur/)

I present [Conferences, regional development and the R-Ladies way](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NyXwah0XD6-8u9nTIQhmJK8ukYRVT8aeyEVbaUVg_V4/edit)

## How many are we and where are we?

In my talk I present the last R-Ladies' numbers __216 chapters__, __61 countries__, __95794 members__ and __3545 events__. As of Oct 18th 2021, R-Ladies in LatAm has as many chapters as USA/Canada (59 chapter, 27%), and the english speaking North America is the only region with more members, __28%__ of R-Ladies are from LatAm. 

## ... and how does this relate to conferences?

In the work [Using R in Latin America: the great, the good, the bad, and the ugly](https://encuesta-user2021-en.netlify.app/#1) by García Alonso, et.al. conducted a survey on how R is used in Latin America. When looking at the results of the participation by gender of those who answered, the number of the total survey shows that female participation is less than male participation. But when you ask if these person belong to a community, then the numbers the numbers are reversed and there is more female participant, reaching 60%.

And here comes one of the most interesting insights from this survey, when asked what is the community of which you feel part, more than __40%__ feel part of __R-Ladies__, in second place (18%) feel part of __LatinR__ and seventh place is __ConectaR__.  

Lest see whay I mention this three communities and how __R-Ladies__ is key in the regional and conference development. 

### 1. Create our own R Conferences

[LatinR](https://latin-r.com/) and [ConectaR](https://www.conectar2019.org/) are two conferences created and runned in the region.  R-Ladies was also the community where the organizers of Latin America _SatuRday_ start talking and help each others.

LatinR born after a combination of message in the R-Ladies Organizers Slack. Heather Turner post an announcement that the R Foundation Conference Committee was interested in the emergence of academic-focused R events in regions not currently covered by useR! and she also send a direct message to _Laura Acion_ and _me_. In less than a week, we had organized our first videoconference to start thinking about how to face the challenge. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What are these <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RLadies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RLadies</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LatAm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LatAm</a> talking about? 🇺🇾🇦🇷🇧🇷🇨🇱<br><br>Stay tuned to find out 😊 <a href="https://t.co/7YmQ8ANlEa">pic.twitter.com/7YmQ8ANlEa</a></p>&mdash; R-Ladies BuenosAires (@RLadiesBA) <a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesBA/status/930598718671327232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This quick response was not the result of mere luck, but the consequence of a year in which the R community — through R-Ladies Chapters, its other local RUGs and social media presence— grew stronger in South America. That we met through R-Ladies allowed us to trust each other to organize the conference even when we did not know each other personally. By mid November everything was set up: a name, a place, a date, and a motivated international organizing committee. As I was already organizing conferences with SADIO (the Argentine society of informatics and operations research), I proposed LatinR as a new event within the JAIIO (the Argentine conference of informatics and operations research) for its first edition in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2018.  After that we have a second edition in Chile and two virtual edition because of COVID-19.

Thanks to this conference we have important personalities of the R Community come to our Region for the fist time or participate given talk and tutorials, like _Jenny Brian, Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Erin Ledell, Alison Presmanes Hill and Maëlle Salmon_.

### 2. Encourage people to participate

R-Ladies has a __Review network__ that provide feedback on abstracts and applications such as scholarships to encourage R-Ladies to apply for these opportunities.  This initiative is lead by Jennifer Thompson + volunteers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We still have our 1:1 abstract review process if you’d prefer not to share in Slack!<br>🙋‍♀️Request a review: <a href="https://t.co/YHZw7XzNEN">https://t.co/YHZw7XzNEN</a><br>🔎Sign up to give feedback: <a href="https://t.co/EbrY3CN0Ig">https://t.co/EbrY3CN0Ig</a> (we 💜 new reviewers! expected workload 1-2 reviews a year) - allies can also be reviewers!

We also have _specific Slack channel_ in our Slack Community call #user2021-community-feedback to discuss, share and get feedback on your abstract, video, slides, etc.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LatinR_Conf</a>, we have a review channel in our Community Slack!

As the twitter say this was inpired in the LatinR slack channel call _#clinicadecharlas_. Thanks to that channel I got feedbak for my RStudio::global talk which become the _first not English language talk in the conference_.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My talk about {learnr} for <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rstudio</a> conf was accepted. <br>The best part was sharing the process with the LatAm community.

### 3. Be creators, not just users

R-Ladies chapter in Latin America help to host tutorials on useR! 2020 that went virtual because COVID-19 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">🔊 Este viernes 24/07 varios capítulos de <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rladies?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rladies</a> de <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Argentina?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Argentina</a> nos unimos para hostear un tutorial de <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/useR2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#useR2020</a> 🎉. <br>Unite a nuestro meetup para aprender con <a href="https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Emil_Hvitfeldt</a> y <a href="https://twitter.com/juliasilge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@juliasilge</a>. <br>Cuando: 17hs (argentina).<a href="https://t.co/9bglrTHgeO">https://t.co/9bglrTHgeO</a> <a href="https://t.co/C5kbAaV5d5">pic.twitter.com/C5kbAaV5d5</a></p>&mdash; R-Ladies Santa Rosa (@RLadiesSR) <a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesSR/status/1285654844003569664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

and also become Communities partner of [RStudio::Global](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/). In 2021 was also useR! 2021 Global, R-Ladies network was _key_ for a global, diverse and inclusive conference because we can invite people from all over the world to be organizers and increase the reach in such way that we have the bigest edition in attendees and countries reached.

* _122_ countries, __16__ were latin american.
* _1806_ attendee, __221__ were latin american.

Most important, the roles that Latin American has were key roles: global coordinators, keynotes, organizers, reviewers, tutors, authors, event facilitators and participants.  You can read more details in [this blog post](https://user2021.r-project.org/blog/2021/11/26/latines_at_user/).

### 4. Diversity and inclusion beyond gender

This diverse team, with a lot of R-Ladies in, allow us to go for diversity and inclusion in other dimensions, beyond gender:

* __Geography__: authors, keynotes, organizing team, pc team from America, Asia, Europe and Oceania.  Every day in different time zones.
* __Language__: content in English, Spanish and French. Author can record their talk in their native language. Keynotes in other language than English.
* __Economic:__  Price according to your country of origin and your employment situation. For both attendees and sponsors. Fee waiver without having to explain why you need it. Financial help (childcare, internet connections).
* __Accessibility__: Planned from the start of the event. Screen reader-friendly and lightweight platform (internet bandwidths). Accessibility guides for content (tutorials and talks). Subtitles in all talks. Subtitles in two languages in the keynotes. Awards to recognize this effort.
* __User Level__: content for all levels. Special events for newcomers. Social events for the communities.
* __Code of conduct__: Code of conduct, training and payment for the task to the team that had to reinforce the CoC.
* __Volunteer time__: useR! was a volunteer effort.  This excludes people that don’t have time to work for free.  Payment for the activities to some roles of the organizing team to allow more people to be part.

The big learning:

## A diverse team that takes into account the intersectionalities of the communities members will improve __any result__.


and that include conferences.
