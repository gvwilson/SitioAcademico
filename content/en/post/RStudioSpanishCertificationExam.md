In 2019 I became a certified RStudio instructor for tidyverse. I wrote about that experience in [this post](https://yabellini.netlify.app/post/rstudiocertification/). 

To get certified you have to take a teacher exam and a technical exam on tidyverse and/or shiny.

In [this post](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/) by Greg Wilson in the RStudio Education blog is the test I took for teaching and tidyverse in English. 

In this same post but choosing Spanish as a language you can find the sample exam in Spanish.
