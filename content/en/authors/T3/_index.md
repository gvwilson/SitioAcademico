## Collaborative and voluntary translation project of "Teaching Tech Together" to Spanish

_Teaching Tech Together_ is a book about teaching programming for people with technical training but without formal training as educators. This project aims to develop a collaborative translation of the book [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html) by [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) for the Spanish-speaking community. The Spanish version can be accessed [here] (http://teachtogether.tech/es/index.html).

### Translations guidelines

In the [project repository](https://github.com/gvwilson/teachtogether.tech) there are detailed the process and aspects to take into account when translating the text, the exercises, references to external materials, diagrams and glossary. The progress status of the project and the responsibilities of the people involved are also made explicit there.

### How to contribute?

This is a project open to the community in which everyone can participate as long as they __adscribe our [code of conduct](http://teachtogether.tech/es/index.html#s:conduct)__.
