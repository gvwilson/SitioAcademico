## Package agromet

The {agromet} package includes a series of functions to calculate climatic and hydrological indices and statistics from tidy data. For example `thresholds()` allows to count the number of observations that meet a certain condition and `average_days()` returns the first and last day of the average year of occurrence of an event.

Other functions such as `spi()` function as function wrappers for other packages and seek to be compatible with the handling of tidy data.

Finally, the package includes a `map()` georeferenced data graphing function with INTA's own style and logo.
