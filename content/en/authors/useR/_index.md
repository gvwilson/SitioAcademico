## The useR! Conference

useR! conferences are non-profit conferences organized by community volunteers for the community, supported by the [R Foundation]((https://www.r-project.org/foundation/)). Attendees include R developers and users who are data scientists, business intelligence specialists, analysts, statisticians from academia and industry, and students.

My first participation in the organization was during 2020 as a contact for R-Ladies in the organization of the tutorials.

For the [2021 edition](https://user2021.r-project.org/about/global-team/) I was one of the Global Coordinators. Also taking charge of the entire tutorial process, leading the communication team (brand, visual identity, website and social networks) and helping the technology team with the configuration of the video conference and streaming infrastructure. I collaborated with the program and content team as part of the definition group of the program committee and the final program.  My job in the diversity team was being part of the partners team as R-Ladies liaison.

useR! 2021 was a conference with a major focus on accessibility, inclusion and diversity; taking into account various dimensions of these aspects: language, geography, age, disability, infrastructure, career status, workplace, etc.
