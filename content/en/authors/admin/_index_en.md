I'm a researcher at INTA (National Institute of Agricultural Technology) and I'm dedicated to apply data science to the agricultural sector. I work in an [Experimental Agricultural Station](https://inta.gob.ar/anguil), so my developments and solutions are related to the productive reality of the province of La Pampa, where I live with my husband and my two beautiful children.

I enjoy teaching a lot, so I spend part of my time teaching courses and writing teaching material on my research topics. I'm co-founder of [MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/), an open, free, volunteer-lead, not-for-profit, educational organization. Since 2019 I’m an [RStudio Certified Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/), since 2020 I'm an [Software Carpentries](https://carpentries.github.io) Certified Instructor and since 2021 I'm a Software Carpentries Certified Trainer. Since 2022 I'm a member of the The Carpentries Execute Council. I lead the translation of [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech) to Spanish and I'm part of the team that translate some lessons by [The Carpentries](https://github.com/Carpentries-ES) also to Spanish. If you’re interested in some [custom, personalized training and workshops](https://yabellini.netlify.com/courses/) please contact me!.

Also, I'm an active member of the R Community: I am part of the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) Global Team and founder and organizer of the [R-Ladies Santa Rosa chapter](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/rladies-santa-rosa/). I am co-founder and chair of [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/) and member of the organizing team of  [useR!2020](https://user2020.r-project.org/),  and [user!2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/). I was part of the team that translated R materials to Spanish (ej: [R for Data Science](https://github.com/cienciadedatos), [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)). 

I relate my work at INTA with my work at the R Community by seeking to make my science as reproducible and open as possible using open computing tools. I am chair, since 2016, of the Argentine Congress of Agroinformatics (CAI) and general chair in 2020 of the Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operational Research ( [JAIIO](http://www.sadio.org.ar/jaiio/)) and member of the editorial commite of the [Electronic Journal de SADIO](https://publicaciones.sadio.org.ar/index.php/EJS/about/editorialTeam)
