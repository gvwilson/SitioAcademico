## My role in the JAIIO

In the years 2020 and 2021, I have been general chair of the JAIIO in its 49th and 50th editions, respectively. In addition, I have been part of the organizing team in previous years as chair of the Argentine AgroInformatics Congress and advising the executive secretariat on communication issues, paper formats, and infrastructure for holding the conference.

## The Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operations Research

The JAIIOs are the Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operations Research.

Since 1961 many JAIIOs have been held, usually in Buenos Aires. Between 500 and 1000 participants attend its parallel sessions presenting works published in its Annals, discussing research results or experiences, or attending conferences and round tables.

Each year tutorials on cutting-edge topics are included for the information of advanced university students or updates of professionals.

Some researchers from Brazilian, Chilean, Uruguayan and other Latin American universities participate in the JAIIOs. Moreover, on several occasions, they were carried out jointly with other Latin American conferences, such as the Latin American Conference on Informatics of the CLEI or the Latin-Ibero-American Congress of Operations Research of ALIO.

From the interaction of the participants, interesting relationships emerged, and projects were developed, such as the Argentine-Brazilian Program for Research and Advanced Studies in Computer Science, which financed several projects and organized five summer schools with more than 2000 students, publishing 38 books.

The JAIIOs have been organized as a set of separate symposia, each one dedicated to a specific topic in one or two days, to reduce the dedication time and increase interaction possibilities for its participants.
