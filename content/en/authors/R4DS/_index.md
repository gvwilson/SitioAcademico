## R for Data Science in Spanish

We are a group of R users who want R to be more accessible in Latin America. For this reason, we translated R for Data Science (R4DS), developed the package {datos} and helped in the translation of the package {dados} in Portuguese. We also organized #DatosDeMiercoles  (Latin American cousin of Tidy Tuesday) and #30d√≠asdegraficos.

### My role in this project

I have been a translator of the book R for Data Science and a contributor and participant to  #DatosDeMiercoles And 30 Days of Graphics.

## Collaborative translation project of "R for Data Science."

This project aims to develop a collaborative translation of the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for the Spanish-speaking community. The Spanish version can be accessed [here](http://es.r4ds.hadley.nz).


## Code of conduct

The R4DS translation project is an open space that aims to generate resources for the Spanish-speaking community through collaborative work dynamics. Therefore, during the translation and revision process, it is expected that people can participate freely, sharing ideas, making suggestions, proposing changes, analyzing points of view, etc., in an atmosphere of respect and collaboration. Likewise, those who participate are expected to make fair, constructive, and purposeful criticism, not value judgments.
At all times, it will be ensured that this is an environment free from harassment and harassment, regardless of sex, identity, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or the lack of it), ideology, nationality, linguistic variant or technological options. Harassment or harassment in any form will not be tolerated. Those who engage in this type of conduct will be permanently marginalized from the work process. Sexual language and images of this type are not appropriate in any space in this project.

## Work materials

In the repository, you will find the materials with the guidelines for the translation and revision process:

* The file [guidelines for translation](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/documentacion-traduccion-r4ds/blob/master/orientaciones-traduccion.md) describes the aspects to take into account when translating the text and code used in each chapter.
* The file [workflow](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/documentacion-traduccion-r4ds/blob/master/flujo-trabajo.md) indicates the sequence of actions throughout the translation and revision process chapters.
* In the file [guidelines for the review](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/documentacion-traduccion-r4ds/blob/master/orientaciones-revision.md), recommendations are provided on the aspects in which it is necessary to look at the time to review a translation and the type of language to use to make recommendations.
* In the file [credits and participation](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/documentacion-traduccion-r4ds/blob/master/creditos-participacion.md) the responsibilities of the people participating in this project and the Chapter assignment for translation and revision. The contributions made by the community through Github are also recorded.
* In the file [progress status](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/documentacion-traduccion-r4ds/blob/master/estado-avance.md), it is indicated in which phase of the process each one of the chapters goes.
