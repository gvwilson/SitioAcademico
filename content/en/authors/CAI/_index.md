## The Argentine Congress on Agroinformatics

The Argentine Congress on Agroinformatics calls for Researchers, Technologists, Developers, Entrepreneurs and Companies related to the agribusiness sector to send papers related to ICTs applied to agricultural, agroindustrial and environmental issues, ranging from experimental to commercial instances.

The agro-industrial sector needs more and better technological solutions to its own problems and those derived from economic to climatic changes, solutions that in turn can be useful to other countries. Many of the solutions to these problems emerge from the contact between researchers, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs and students whose ideas and developments complement each other.

Since 2016 I'm chair of the Congress on AgroInformatics in the framework of the Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operations Research (JAIIO). Before occupying that role, I was part of the organizing committee and the scientific committee. In the 2016-2021 period, we have concentrated our efforts on improving the participation of women in different roles, reaching more regions within Argentina, and internationalizing the congress regionally. Some results and analyses of these efforts can be seen in the related materials.
