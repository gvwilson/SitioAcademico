## Packages SisINTAR

The SISINTAR package allows downloading, reading and manipulating soil profile data from INTA's soil information system, called [SISINTA](http://sisinta.inta.gob.ar/).

SISINTA is an information system, developed specifically to store soil information. The database stores soil profile data, including field and laboratory data, as well as the location in different coordinate systems. Allows searches by attributes and location. Profiles can be grouped into series or projects. SISINTA intended to digitize and incorporate pre-existing soil information that is often exposed to deterioration or loss and is generally not available.

Law 26,899 in Argentina, on the Creation of Open Access Institutional Digital Repositories, Own or Shared, establishes that the institutions of the National System of Science and Technology and that receive funding from the National State must create free and open access institutional digital repositories in which will deposit the national scientific-technological production.

According to the foundations of the law, the model of open access to scientific-technological production implies that users of this type of material can, free of charge, read, download, copy, distribute, print, search or link the full texts of scientific articles, and use them for legitimate purposes linked to scientific research, education or public policy management, without other economic, legal or technical barriers than those posed by the Internet itself.

The SISINTA project, although it predates the law enacted in November 2013, accompanies the idea of free community access to scientific-technical information, contributing to the nationalization of scientific production in the country and benefiting society in general.
