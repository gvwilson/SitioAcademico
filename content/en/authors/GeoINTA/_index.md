## My role in GeoINTA

I am responsible for La Pampa's node of the Spatial Data Infrastructure (IDE) of INTA.

In 2016, together with Santiago Banchero, I received the [Special Mention for Excellence in Electronic Government in the Success Initiatives category](https://inta.gob.ar/noticias/reconocimiento-nacional-para-geointa) for the work [GeoINTA: sharing data through INTA's Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://inta.gob.ar/documentos/geointa-compartiendo-datos-por-medio-de-la-infraestructura-de-datos -spacial-of-inta).


## What is GeoINTA?

GeoINTA is the Spatial Data Infrastructure (IDE) of INTA.

GeoINTA is an information system created by INTA professionals, with free access, which allows you to query maps, associated databases, images, and photomosaics simply from the Internet. It combines web visualization tools with databases of natural, productive, and agricultural risk resources, allowing consultation by geographical coordinates and the combination of different maps, generating layered analysis.

GeoINTA is based on a computer architecture that uses state-of-the-art free and commercial software and its technological developments to offer everyone the possibility of using a Geographic information system through the Web.


## What possibilities does GeoINTA offer?

Access georeferenced information at any time and from any site, locate sites of interest by their geographical coordinates, and browse extensive databases and attributes that describe each of those points of interest consulted.

GeoINTA is much more than a visualization system since it allows the query of updated databases. Thus, it is web access, but it is an infrastructure of networked geoservers that enable the producer of data and geospatial information to be brought closer to the user, directly, in real-time.

## Who publishes data and information on GeoINTA?

All INTA projects, the various sensor networks: satellite, terrestrial, meteorological, and radar, as well as the INTA information networks, can access GeoINTA for the dissemination of their research and surveys in a georeferenced manner.

In addition, any academic or institutional group can contact to disseminate their projects through this system. The AERN 4641 project that originates GeoINTA encourages the strengthening of intra- and inter-institutional networks.

## What geographic data standards and norms does GeoINTA use?

The entire GeoINTA design follows the technical standards for the presentation of spatial data, meeting the ISO, FGDC, and national IGN standards. It is also based on OGC's experience and development suggestions.

GeoINTA adopts the WGS 84 geographic coordinate system (latitude and longitude), ellipsoid, and datum.

The geodetic reference framework adopted is the POSGAR 94 system (Argentine Geodesic Positions) that materializes the WGS 84 Reference System. It is the official system in force since 1997 that replaced the local system Campo Inchauspe 1969.
The project facilitates access to metadata through a Catalog for the general public and a metadata query system. A set of 30 attributes were selected according to ISO 19115 standards and ISO / TC 211 documentation.
