## My role at The Carpentries

In 2020 I was certified as a _Software Carpentries_ instructor and in 2021 as a _Trainer_. I have also been involved in translating various community lessons into Spanish and teaching self organizer workshop at my work.

## Vision

Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

## Mission

The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and supporting research.
