I am a researcher at INTA (National Institute of Agricultural Technology) and I am dedicated to apply data science to the agricultural sector. I work in an Experimental Agricultural Station, so my developments and solutions are related to the productive reality of the province of La Pampa, where I live with my husband and my two beautiful children.

I enjoy teaching a lot, so I spend part of my time teaching courses and writing teaching material on my research topics. You can access these materials on this website. 

Also, I am a member of the R-Ladies community (I am part of the Global Team and co-organizer of the Santa Rosa chapter) that seeks to bridge the gender gap between the users of the R language.

I relate my work at INTA with my work at R-Ladies by seeking to make my science as reproducible and open as possible using open computing tools.
