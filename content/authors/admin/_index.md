I am a researcher at INTA (National Institute of Agricultural Technology) and I am dedicated to apply data science to the agricultural sector. I work in an [Experimental Agricultural Station](https://inta.gob.ar/anguil), so my developments and solutions are related to the productive reality of the province of La Pampa, where I live with my husband and my two beautiful children.

I enjoy teaching a lot, so I spend part of my time teaching courses and writing teaching material on my research topics. Since 2019 I’m an [RStudio Education Certified Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/). If you’re interested in some [custom, personalized training and workshops](https://yabellini.netlify.com/courses/) please contact me!.

Also, I am an active member of the R Community: I am part of the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) Global Team and founder and organizer of the [R-Ladies Santa Rosa chapter](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/rladies-santa-rosa/). I am co-founder and chair of [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/) and I was part of the team that translated [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) into [Spanish](https://github.com/cienciadedatos). 

I relate my work at INTA with my work at the R Community by seeking to make my science as reproducible and open as possible using open computing tools. I am chair, since 2016, of the Argentine Congress of Agroinformatics (CAI) and general chair in 2020 of the Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operational Research ( [JAIIO](http://www.sadio.org.ar/jaiio/))
