  I was born in 1977 in [Juan José Paso](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Paso_(Buenos_Aires)), a small town in [Argentina](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina). I was six year old when my elementary school bought a computer (one computer for the entire school and the only one in the whole town). The moment I saw it I felt love at first sight. They taught us LOGO.
  
  A few years later, we moved to [Ingeniero Luiggi](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingeniero_Luiggi) because my family had lost almost everything due to a flood. This new place was close to [Realicó](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realic%C3%B3) where I could study programming. So between ages 9 and 14 my parents drove 80 kilometers every Saturday to take me to class.  We didn’t have a car, and there was no public transport because it was a rural area, but since my dad repairs vehicles, his clients would lend him their cars to make the trip. I learned BASIC.
  
  When I was 15, I started working teaching informatics. Since then, I have never stopped teaching and learning computing. In 1996 I became the first generation in my family obtaining a high school diploma. At that time the whole family moved again, to [Santa Rosa](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa_(La_Pampa)) with the hope I can study at the university. My family came with me because we didn't have the money to send me to study.  I couldn't stop working, so I was a teacher at elementary and high school and I taught to teachers through the _Red Federal de Formación Docente Continua (Ministry of Education)_ from 1996 to 1999. I also starting developing software using dbase and FoxPro. I made my first sold (a car racing management system) in 1997. I also learned Pascal, QBasic and C++.
  
  In 1998 I started working at [INTA](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta), where I won two scholarships to finish my degree in computer science (2005) and my master’s degree in data minig and knowledge discovery (2015). I became a scientist starting as [Research Software Engineer](https://researchsoftware.org/) (although I didn't know the job had that name). We code in C++ and ASP+HTML, then we moved to .Net framework (ASP.Net, Visual Basic .Net and C#); in 2009 I learn Python that I used for my master's thesis and in 2010 I learn R which is my favorite language. I then began to have management roles such as Head of Division/Group/Area, Regional/Thematic Advisor, Coordinator (PI) of several research projects and strategic knowledge networks, and the first woman member of the Board of Directors of the Natural Resources Research Center. I also received several awards and recognitions for the results of my developments and research.
  
  In 2019 I started to teach at the undergraduate and graduate level for two diploma courses (Data Science in Public Policy and New Technologies for Agriculture) and a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science.  I also helped to create a master's degree in Data Science.
  
  I also organize a lot of events and conferences which led me to become chair of the AgroInformatics Congress from 2016 to 2021, general chair of the 49th and 50th [Jornadas Argentinas de Informática](https://www.sadio.org.ar/jaiio/), founder and chair of [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/), global coordinator of [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/), Conference Team Lead at [RForwards](https://forwards.github.io/), and a member of the useR! Working Group.
  
  In 2017 I became involved in communities of practice, particularly [R-Ladies](https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1485334386161639425) and the R-Community that impact my life and career in such a positive way. I co-founded the [R-Ladies Santa Rosa](https://www.meetup.com/es/rladies-santa-rosa/) chapter in 2017 and became a member of the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) Global Team in 2018. That same year we started the collaborative translation to Spanish of [R for Data Science](https://github.com/cienciadedatos). I was involved in the translation of [R-Ladies's Rules and Guidelines](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/tree/master/ES), some lessons by [The Carpentries](https://github.com/Carpentries-ES) and severals [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). This experience helped me to lead the translation of [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech) in 2020. 
  
  These communities also gave me the opportunity to improve myself, in 2019 I became an [RStudio Certified Trainer](/blog/2020_rstudiocertification_en/), since 2020 I'm an [Software Carpentries Certified Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and since 2021 I'm a  [Carpentries Certified Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/). In 2022 the community elected me as a member of the [The Carpentries Execute Council](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/12/announcing-2022-executive-council/). 
  I am a prolific international bilingual speaker and teacher thanks to these communities.  
  
  The community experience is so empowering that it encouraged me to co-found, in 2020, a new community called [MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/), an open, free, volunteer-lead, not-for-profit, educational organization that teach how to teach and technical skill to people from undeserved countries.
  
  Last but not least, in 2004 I met the man who became my partner in life and in 2012, 2013 and 2015 we became proud parents. In 2012 we lost Ana, our first child. Now we enjoy watching with wonder what beautiful people our other two kids are becoming.
