  I was born in 1977 in [Juan José Paso](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Paso_(Buenos_Aires)), a small town in a rural area in [Argentina](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina), South America. I was six years old when my elementary school bought a computer (one computer for the entire school and the only one in the whole town). The moment I saw it I felt love at first sight.
  
  A few years later, we moved to another town because my family had lost almost everything due to a flood. This new place was close to another town where I could study programming. So between ages 9 and 14 my parents drove 80 kilometers every Saturday to take me to class.  We didn’t have a car, and there was no public transport because it was a rural area, but since my dad fixes cars, his clients would lend him their cars to make the trip.
  
  When I was 15, I started working teaching informatics.  Since then, I never stopped teaching and learning computing. I finished high school in 1996,becoming the first generation in my family in obtein a high school diploma. I was a teacher at elementary and high school from 1997 to 1999. I sold my first software (a car racing management system) in 1997.
  
  In 1998 I started working at [INTA](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta), where I won two scholarships to finish my degree in computer science (2005) and my master’s degree in data minig and knowledge discovery (2015). I become a scientist starting as [Research Software Engineer](https://researchsoftware.org/) (although I didn't know the job had that name). I then began to have management roles such as Head of Division, Group and Area, Regional Advisor, Coordinator (PI) of several research projects and strategic knowledge networks, and the first women member of the Board of Directors of the Natural Resources Research Center. 
  
  I also start to organize a lot of events and conferences that led me to become chair of the AgroInformatics Congress from 2016 to 2021, general chair of the 49th and 50th [Jornadas Argentinas de Informática](https://www.sadio.org.ar/jaiio/), founder and chair of [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/), global coordinator of [useR! 2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/), Conference Team Lead at [RForwards](https://forwards.github.io/), and a member of the useR! Working Group.
  
  In 2004 I met the men who become my partner in life and in 2012, 2013 and 2015 we became proud parents. In 2012 we lost Ana, our first child.
  
  In 2017 I became involved in communities of practice, particularly R-Ladies and the R-Community that impact my life and career in such a positive way. I co-founded the [R-Ladies Santa Rosa](https://www.meetup.com/es/rladies-santa-rosa/) chapter and become a member of the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) Global Team in 2018. That same year we start the collaborative traslation to Spanish of [R for Data Science](https://github.com/cienciadedatos). I was involved in the translation of Rules and Guidelines of R-Ladies, some lessons by [The Carpentries](https://github.com/Carpentries-ES) and severals [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). This experience help me to lead the translation of [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech) in 2020. 
  
  These communities also gave me the opportunity to improve myself, in 2019 I become an [RStudio Certified Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/), since 2020 I'm an [Software Carpentries Certified Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and since 2021 I'm a  [Carpentries Certified Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/). In 2022 the community elected me as a member of the The Carpentries Execute Council. 
  
  I delivery a lot of talk at events and courses and thanks to these communities I become an international bilingual speaker.  
  
  The community experience is so empowering that encouraged me to co-found in 2020 a new community called [MetaDocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/), an open, free, volunteer-lead, not-for-profit, educational organization that teach how to teach and technical skill to people from undeserved countries.
  
  In 2019 I started to teach at the undergraduate and graduate level (Programming 101, Visualization 101, Big Data 101 and Data Bases 101) for two diploma courses (Data Science in Public Policy and New Technologies for Agriculture) and a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science.  I also helped to create a master's degree in Data Science.
