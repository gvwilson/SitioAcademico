This month I was invited by the [CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/) team to collaborate with the revision of a tip sheet on accessibility in online events. 

Both, online events and the accessibility of different knowledge sharing spaces, are topics that interest me, so I accepted the invitation immediately. 

In [this blog post](https://www.cscce.org/2023/06/28/new-cscce-tip-sheet-highlights-12-guiding-questions-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-next-virtual-event/) the CSCEE team summarizes the main take away from the tip sheet:

1. Don’t let accessibility become an afterthought.

2. If you don’t know, ask.

3. Progress over perfection.
