Today is my last day at [MetaDocencia](/project/metadocencia/). 

Today marks the end of one of the most wonderful cycles of which I have been part.

What's next, I hope to tell you soon, but now it's time to review the road traveled (and enjoy it again):


💜 I was **co-founder** and part of the MetaDocencia's **Core Team** for two years.

🤓 Of the **six** [courses](/courses/) we offer I **co-designed** and **co-taught** **five**.

🍎 Of the **112** editions of the courses and [book club](/blog/2022_metadocencia_club_lectura_t3/) I taught in **56**, this mean **I taught in 50%** of all the traininigs and events organize by MetaDocencia.

🌎 I taught **884** people from **19** countries that teach to **15796** students.

🤗 Organized events with **14** friend communities.

💬 Participated in **12** conferences featuring MetaDocencia.

✍️ I wrote **30** of the **46** blog posts on our website (**five** bilingual) and encouraged **four** more to be written.

😎 I made the **1st version** of our **website** and our **impact report**.

📌 I organized the **collaborative building** of our mission and vision.

💻 I developed an **R package** with our templates.

🍏 I proposed the apple as the logo and [led the redesign of our visual identity](/blog/2022_metadocencia_comunicacion/).

📒 I led the [translation of our materials into Portuguese](/blog/2022_traduccion_portugues/).

📺 I was in charge of the _communication_ and _accessibility_ teams.

📦 I made the first version of [MetaDocencia in a box](/project/metadocenciaenunacaja/).

📘 I led the [translation of Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/).

🎓I helped **28** people get certified as The Carpentries Instructors.


As always, **the best part of any trip are the people I shared the road with**:

My **eternal** thanks to:

* _Paola Corrales_ and _Elio Campitelli_ with whom we co-founded MetaDocencia and directed its destinies for almost two years. 🙌🙏

* the accessibility team, with whom I worked side by side, _Ivan Poggio, Mariela Rajngewerc and Patricia Loto_, for the genuine work to include as many people as possible.

* the people who were part of the communication team when I was responsible for it: _Romina Pendino, Andrea Gomez Vargas, Roxana Noelia Villafañe, Ailin Mandola, Alejandra Wrobel, Alejandra Bellini,  Lucio Casalla and Francisco Etchart_.

* the Portuguese translation team _Beatriz Milz, Maxwell Oliveira and Claudiano Neto._

* the reporting team _Violeta Roizman and Amit Kohli_, who used my first version of the report, to improve it and amaze us every year with all that we had done as volunteers.

* the beautiful group with whom we designed and taught courses: _Paola Corrales, Mariela Rajngewerc, Violeta Roizman, Patricia Loto, Nicolás Palopoli, Romina Pendino, Elio Campitelli, and Irene Vazano_.

* those who made the bookclub possible: _Jesica Formoso, Mónica Alonso, Elio Campitelli, Paola Corrales, Alejandra Bellini, and Ernesto Mirt_.

* the advisory team for their guidance, advice and help: _Kate Hertweck, Raniere Silva, Mine Dogucu, Mortara Sara, Malvika Sharan, Thema White, and Brianna Morrison_.

* _Greg Wilson_ for being a true ally.

* the friends communities: _R-Ladies, The Carpentries, The Software Sustainability Institute, The Turing Way, Women in Bioinformatic & Data Science LA, Las de Sistemas, LatinR, useR! R Forwards, Sadio, Red Inta Joven and RStudio_.

* our sponsors: _R-Ladies, INTA, CZI, Code for Science and Society, Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation and Open Bioinformatics Foundation_.

... and to the **2000+** people who passed through MetaDocencia.🍏🍎

You all enriched my life.
**Thank you**, Gracias, Obrigada, for teaching me so much. 🙌

I hope that life will give us the opportunity to cross paths again. 🙏
