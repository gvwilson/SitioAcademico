At the end of 2021 I started my **to-don't list**, it is a list of things that you are _not_ going to do because you already have too much on the go.  Mine looks like this:


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting my 2022 to-don&#39;t list:<br>- I will not be chair or organizer of JAIIO &amp; CAI<br>- I will not direct/co-direct any undergraduate or graduate thesis<br>- I will not sign any new R&amp;D cooperation agreements<br>- I will not join any new community<br>- I will not eat so much wheat flour</p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1471099682948530185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Let's see how thing are going: 

- *I will not be chair or organizer of JAIIO (Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operations Research) & CAI (AgroInformatics Congress)*: I was chair of the 49 and 50 JAIIO (2020 and 2021) and CAI's chair from 2016 until 2021. The CAI organizers invited me to review some papers, which I gladly accepted. So we can say that *I have fulfilled this commitment*.

- *I will not direct/co-direct any undergraduate or graduate thesis*: _Accomplished_. I really liked this job when I was at INTA, but now I'm able to help people from another role.  

- *I will not sign any new R&D cooperation agreements*: _Accomplished_. I was doing this as an INTA employee and since I am on unpaid leave, I have not signed any new cooperation agreements and we have successfully completed the ones I had active.

- *I will not join any new community*: I have _failed_ miserably.  This year in addition to becoming [rOpenSci's Community Manager](https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/06/21/introducing-yanina/) (I was already part of the community), I joined [OpenHeroines](https://openheroines.org/), [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/) (which is the fiscal sponsor of rOpenSci), [CSVConf](https://csvconf.com/), and I'm now a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/?country=Argentina). 

- *I will not eat so much wheat flour*: another _failure_, although I do eat less wheat flour than before, but still.

So, we can say _3 of 5_ until now. _Not so bad?_
