I love learning about how to teach other people to code.

**Yes, teaching is a skill that you can learn!**

Unfortunately, when I first got interested, I had a hard time figuring out where to start for a variety of reasons, from restricted access to the material to very specialized language suitable only for experts to not knowing enough to know what and where to look.

### So, if you are trying to learn more about how to teach programming, here's the best way to get started:

* **Read This Book**: [How Learning Works](https://a.co/d/59bQnJN) by _Ambrose, Bridges, Dipietro, Lovett and Norman_, will give you a lay of the land, and is a helpful way to get your bearings for teaching any topic.

* **Watch This YouTube Video**: [How to teach programming (and other things)](https://youtu.be/g1ib43q3uXQ?si=eq-Eh37U0KGaI-fc) by _Felienne Hermans_ is a must-watch beginner resource for anyone interested in education.

* **Listen To This Podcast Episode**: And if you really want to start going down the rabbit hole, listen to [462: Spontaneously High Performing](https://embedded.fm/transcripts/462) by [embedded.fm](https://embedded.fm) with Marian Petre by Christopher White and Elecia White.

These 3 resources will give you a lot of insight and accelerate your learning process.
