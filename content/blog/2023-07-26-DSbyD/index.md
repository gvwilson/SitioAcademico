Natalia Morandeira and I wrote a chapter for the new Data Science by Design book. Our section is called Multilingual Data Science. Ten Tips to Translate Science and Tech Content, and we share lessons learned in translating and localizing material to Spanish.

Writing this chapter allowed us to realize an idea we had when we finished localizing the Teaching Tech Together book.  We wanted to share in an orderly and clear way our experience, processes and tools that we thought might be useful to other people and communities. 

When the project lead of Data Science by Design let us know they will try to translate all the other chapters inspired by our work, it was the best outcome than a writing piece can have. 

And for me, personally, having a chapter of a book written with a friend is the icing on the cake. 

The [chapter is open access in the book webpage](http://datasciencebydesign.org/blog/multilingual-data-science) and you can also [buy the book](https://www.lulu.com/shop/kelsey-campbell-and-cathryn-ploehn-and-nancy-smith-and-julia-evans/our-environment/paperback/product-z6dgkz.html?page=1&pageSize=4).
