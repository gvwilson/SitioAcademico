One more year where the bonds, friendships, and family wrap up the best moments.
Another year with ups and downs, with learning, with a lot of work and achievements, and with my communities that seek to make this world a better place for everyone at the center of my activities. 

Thanks to all the people who shared with me this year's journey. Here is a monthly summary of my 2023.

## January

January was for family summer vacations, the [kickoff meetings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K4HDAvxk3MkKN2DCr_oYSx1lE73fDI8Ri1Bxo8z83ow/edit?usp=sharing) for the [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/), and the first rOpenSci [Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/jan2023-targets/) of the year about the target package. I also developed rOpenSCi Champions Program mentors' [training](https://ropensci-training.github.io/ropensci-mentors/) and [support material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFSxy02-OBf9zwz1Didi7J6Opz93UWIfTHtPEOWQLw/edit).

We start the R-Ladies Leadership Team weekly meetings.

We say goodbye to my grandma. 

## February

February was for [VISA interviews](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-05-06-visa/), learning [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/), [teaching for the rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/08/04/champions-program-training/), and met Natalia Morandeira and [Mariela Rajngewerc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrajngewerc/) in-person. 

I got renewed for another year as a [GitHub star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/yabellini/) and I was [interviewed](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/02/28/happy-23rd-birthday-r) by the RConsortium to celebrate the 23 anniversary of the R language. I delivered several talks [about rOpenSci](/talk/2023_torontoworkshopreproducibility/) to [other](/talk/2023_bioconductor/) [communities](/talk/2023_eurobioimaging/). It feels so good when other people find what you are doing useful. 

It was also for grow vegetables in our garden and for reading [The Grieving Brain by Mary-Frances O’Connor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58007238-the-grieving-brain?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_13).

## March

My kids started their school, and I started teaching another round of my undergrad course on [Data Management](https://yabellini.netlify.app/courses/gestiondatos/) and Visualization for Data Science at [UNAB](https://www.unab.edu.ar/analisis-datos.html), Argentina.

We have the [first version in Spanish](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/es/preface.es.html) of the [rOpenSci comprehensive guide to software development](https://devguide.ropensci.org/). 

It was also a month of restoring books, enjoying my new bookcase, and starting swimming - I completed 21000 meters. 

{{< figure src="march.png" alt="New bookcase that look like a maze, front cover of four restored spanish books, family picture of the first day at school of Yani's kids" caption="New bookcase build by Yani's hubby, Yani's old restored books and first day at school of Yani's kids">}}

## April

[CSV,Conf](https://csvconf.com/2023/) came to South America and Buenos Aires for the first time. [I was part of the organizing team](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-04-06-pre-csv-conf/) and [delivered a talk about community connections](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/2023_csv_conf/). That my first talk in English at an in-person conference happened in Buenos Aires is ironic and hilarious.

We also have [The Carpentries Executive Council retreat](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/05/EC-retreat/) in Buenos Aires and the CZI’s Accelerating Open Science in Latin America meeting where I lead a working session on [How do you measure the impact of a champions program?](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/06/15/ropensci-champions-impact-en/). 

I met many incredible people in person at these three events! Including Karthik Ram, rOpenSci PI. 

{{< figure src="april-conf.png" alt="Group pictures from CZI, The Carpentries and CSV,Conf" caption="Group pictures from CZI, The Carpentries and CSV,Conf">}}

R-Ladies Global Team [opened a call for volunteers to serve in multiple roles](https://www.rladies.org/news/2023-04-11-global-team-recruiting/) critical to the sustainable growth and maintenance of the organization

I read [Driftwood by Marie Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51600238-driftwood?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_23) and swam 10200 meters. 

## May

This month was for planning the second cohort of the [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/) and the [community calls](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/) for the rest of the year.

I was in an [panel as GitHub Star with Thomas Dohmke](/talk/2023_github/), GitHub’s CEO, at the University of Buenos Aires, and  [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) invited me to share a [talk about coding style and testing](/talk/2023_ols/) for their OLS-7 cohort.  

I enjoyed teaching [Developing Software Together: using Git](https://yabellini.netlify.app/courses/git-developing-software-together/) with [Paola Corrales](https://paocorrales.github.io) for the applicants of the rOpenSci Champions Program.

I also read [Lab Girl by Hope Jahren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733983-lab-girl?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_8), [Avatar Legacy](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender:_Legacy), [Nettle and Bone by T. Kingfisher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56179377-nettle-bone?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11), and I swam 20800 meters.

## June

June is for [remember Ana](/blog/2023-06-11-eleven/).

We have our community call [{targets} in Action](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/jan2023-targets/), and [I made some changes to our process to organize these community calls](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/2023_github_cscce/). rOpenSci [left X (former Twitter)](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/06/14/ropensci-communication-channels-en/). 

I collaborated on a [tip sheet that explores 12 guiding questions to help improve the accessibility of virtual events](https://www.cscce.org/2023/06/28/new-cscce-tip-sheet-highlights-12-guiding-questions-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-next-virtual-event/).

The book [Data Science by Design Anthology Vol. 2. Our Environment.](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-07-26-dsbyd/) was published! [Natalia Morandeira](https://nmorandeira.netlify.app) and I wrote a chapter called [Multilingual Data Science. Ten Tips to Translate Science and Tech Content](http://datasciencebydesign.org/blog/multilingual-data-science). It is extraordinary to publish something you wrote with a friend.

Once again, I taught the _Agro Big Data_ course in the _Diploma of New Technologies in Agriculture_ at the Universidad de la Empresa, Uruguay.

I read [Turning Darkness into Light by Marie Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41555968-turning-darkness-into-light) and [Tales of the Unexpected by Roald Dahl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394689.Tales_of_the_Unexpected). 

I swam 20200 meters.


## July

It was a month to share the call for the rOpeSci Champions Program. We featured our Champions and Mentors in a great [community call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/). The Portuguese-speaking community [start translating our comprehensive software development guide](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/pt/maintenance_cheatsheet.pt).

I restarted my work on the [second edition and Spanish version of Teaching Tech Together](https://teachingtechtogether.netlify.app/). We created and taught a [12-hour training in Spanish based on the book](https://yabellini.netlify.app/courses/t3es/). 

I taught the Introduction to Data Science for Agriculture course of the [Latin American Diploma in AgroAnalitycs](https://www.uces.edu.ar/carreras-escuela-negocios/gestion-y-administracion/diplomado-agroanalytics) at UCES, Argentina.

I quit my teaching position at UNAB. We enjoyed the winter school holidays. No swimming in winter.  

## August

August was to learn how to swimming butterfly style and swim 20800 meters. I was also to paint my kids' room wall with a monster city. 

I delivered [3 talks](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/page/2/), had a [nice chat with Data Umbrella about my experience in communities](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/yanina-community) and help people with their Champions Program application.

We start onboarding the new member of the R-Ladies Global Team and offboarding some valuable members who have served the community for many years. This means we start [using, adjusting and testing all the changes we made to our process](https://youtu.be/awTzbYXTlSc?si=aGhwON4IzlsBB-ZO).


## September

I attended [my first Posit Conf in person](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-12-11-posit-conf/ )!!! Sharing those days with the complete new R-Ladies’ Leadership Team ([Shannon](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/blog), [Avery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averi-giudicessi/), [Mo](https://drmowinckels.io), and [Riva](https://rivaquiroga.cl)) and one of the founders, [Hannah Frik](https://www.frick.ws), was the icing on the cake. We held an [R-Ladies Meetup with R-Ladies Chicago](https://rladies.org/news/2023-10-09-positconf-chicago-meetup/) to close the conference. Another event were I had the opportunity to see many awesome people in person for the first time.

I joined the R-Ladies Mexico chapters to share [what we do at  rOpenSci](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fXtbMDMR-EGMszJvIp1uoJ4LxZ5hhuKNBQwYjVKbcoQ/edit?usp=sharing) and news about R-Ladies. 

I taught the [Application Seminar 1 on Reproducible reporting with R](https://yabellini.github.io/AgroReportesConR/), and the _Application Seminar 2 on Agricultural Data Science_ for the [AgroAnalytics Diploma of the Austral University](https://www.austral.edu.ar/ingenieria-posgrados/diplomaturas/diplomatura-en-business-intelligence-agro/), Argentina. 

I got the [Emerging Leader Ascent certification by Lead Belay](https://www.leadbelay.com/program-details#:~:text=The%20Emerging%20Leader%20Ascent%20is,greatest%20challenges%20of%20their%20careers.) - thanks [NUMFocus](https://numfocus.org) for this opportunity. 

I swam 17600 meters and crafted gifts for my friends - but not simultaneously. 

{{< figure src="rook.png" alt="Chiken, chiken baby and Chess rooks we build with my family for our friends" caption="Chikens and Chess rook we build with my family for our friends.">}}

## October

October was for *friendship* and *travels*. 

I finally went to Toronto and spent five fabulous days with [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) and his family. I meet [Mike Hoye](https://github.com/mhoye), I walked and biked, try a lot of new food, saw some of the autum colors, and cooked [empanadas](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=define%3A+empanadas&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) with Sadie.  I participated in a workshop to discuss how to publish live interactive papers, organized by the University of Toronto. 

After Canada, my family and I traveled to Montevideo, Uruguay, to participate in [LatinR 2023](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-11-05-latinr-2023/). I was co-chair again. I also saw and meet in person many many great people. My children saw me give a talk and learned about the community I talk so much about. They also saw the sea and the beach for the first time. 

My family returned to Argentina, but I traveled to Madrid for the rOpenSci meeting. I met my co-workers (Karthik, Noam, mark, Steffi, Jeroen, Maëlle and Juanjo) in person, and we had a very nice time together and thought about the rOpenSci future. It was very special to get to know [Maëlle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu) in person. We have known each other since 2017 because of R-Ladies. It is fantastic to work with and learn from her - and to interchange books. 

{{< figure src="trips.png" alt="Madrid at nigth, Montevideo sunset, Toronto downtown from above, and autum leaf colors, Chicago bean and wheel, Toronto aquarium, food and Chicago buildings" caption="Ladscapes and food from Madrid, Montevideo, Toronto and Chicago">}}

I moderated the [The Carpentries 25th Aniversary Latin America Highlight](https://hachyderm.io/@thecarpentries/111324211511136974) and Alycia Crall, Oscar Mansiyana and I published our [Mastodon Quick Start Guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10019853) to support everyone willing to move to Mastodon. The Carpentries left X, too. 

I taught the _Agroanalytics Application Seminar 3 on Remote Sensing and Modeling_ for The Austral University and reviewed [RConsortium ISC grant proposals](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/governance). 

October was also for reading [Guards, Guards by Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guards!_Guards!), and [The Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49867430-hench).

We finished the [first bilingual version of our translation and localization guidelines](https://translationguide.ropensci.org) and [R packages to support localizations](https://ropensci.org/multilingual-publishing/). 

We wrapped up the project [The Stars of R-Universe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/06/r-universe-stars-finale/) that I developed with my sister Alejandra Bellini.  We also wrapped up the first cohort of the champions program. 

The Master's Degree in Data Mining of the UTN Regional Rosario, that I helped to build, got CONEAU’s accreditation. I taught the Machine Learning course for the Latin American Agroanalytics Diplo at UCES. 

[R-Ladies leave X](https://rladies.org/news/2023-11-10-mastodon-meet-the-r-ladies/). I attended Nova, [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com) and I give a [keynote](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/2023_rday_colombia/) at [R Day Colombia](https://rday-colombia.github.io/2023/). I was interviewd by the [Embedded podcast: Dinosaurs, Pirates and Spaceships](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/2023_embedded_podcast/). 

I swam 16200 meters and had chocolate cake for my birthday. It was also for reading [The Girls with All the Gift](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17235026-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts) by M.R.
