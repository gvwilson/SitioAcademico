It's Bring Your Own Data week for #TidyTuesday, and I decided to analyze my records of events.

At the academy we have the habit of recording everything and I continue to write down the different events in which I participate even though I no longer work at INTA.

## Dataset
In addition to recording what I did this year, I have been cleaning up the data, completing the information and removing duplicates.

My dataset has xx variables:

Title, institutions, type, date, year, people, link


The idea of this analysis is to visualize not only the number of events over time, but also the types of events, the roles I played and the number of people I reached during this time.

## Number of events by year 


## Types of events and roles


## Outreach
