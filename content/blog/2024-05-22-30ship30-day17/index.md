**I have been writing in English for 16 Days non-stop. Yay!**

Today I want to share two apps I can't live without when it comes to writing content in English:

## DeepL and Grammarly

And here's why:

* It is usually easier for me to write in my native language (Spanish) and then translate to English. DeepL gives the best results in translations.

* DeepL allows me to choose between several options according to the context and also has a dictionary available when I select a word given several options, their definition, synonyms, and antonyms.

* After the translations, Grammarly helps with grammar and punctuation, as well as the clarity and tone of the text.

* If I write the text in English from scratch, Grammarly also checks my writing and not only corrects grammar and punctuation but also gives suggestions to clarify or simplify the text.

* Both have free options. I use the free version of DeepL and the paid version of Grammarly.

If you want to improve your writing, understand why to change a text, and learn new words and expressions, I can't recommend using these apps enough.
