The "[Birds of a Feather](http://community.rstudio.com/bof)" (BoF) sessions at the [2020 RStudio Conference](https://rstudio.com/conference/) were a place where R-users with similar backgrounds, interests, and aspirations could connect in a low-stress social setting. In other words - these sessions let "birds of a feather flock together." Building on the 2019 conference swag, we rolled out a bunch of new BoF buttons for rstudio::conf 2020.

Here we’ll share the process for how some of the designs were created, including several that truly involved a flock of contributors (names for groups of birds are from [Bird Spot](https://www.birdspot.co.uk/articles/collective-nouns-for-birds)).

#### Well, what can we realistically fit on a 1.5" button?

The cool and challenging thing about designing the BoF buttons was the size restriction. In a 1.5" button, we wanted to create designs that: 

- Reflect the group name and/or community
- Include at least one bird
- Are obviously distinguishable for each group 
- Add some readable text
- Oh also, all while setting an approachable tone. 

It turns out the answer to "What can you fit on a 1.5" button?" is...actually quite a lot. Here are a few of the designs: 

#### Data science team leaders
Featuring 80’s beach volleyball sandpiper coach leading a team of R users:

**Fun fact:** a group of sandpipers can be called a *fling* or a *bind*. 

#### Natural language processing
Featuring a wordy bird - a parrot!

**Fun facts:** Groups of parrots are sometimes called *companies*, a *prattles*, or *pandemoniums*. Also, parrots are the only birds that can use their feet (like hands) to serve themselves food. And one more thing - the text in the background of this design is a line from Patrick Rothfuss’ *The Name of the Wind* (one of artist @allison_horst’s favorite books). 

#### The spatially aware carrier pigeon...
...checking flight routes before setting off on their next delivery:

**Fun fact:** A group of pigeons is sometimes called a *kit* or a *loft*.

### Community-driven designs

Several of the designs - especially R-Latin America, R-Africa, and R-Ladies - depended on recommendations, insights, and feedback from multiple members of those communities. Here, we’ll highlight elements and contributors of several community-driven designs. 

#### R-Latin America

The R-Latin America BoF button was truly a collaborative effort, with every detail - from bird to branch - created based on ideas and input from R-Latin America community members. Massive thanks to the R-Latin America design contributors (and thank you to @yabellini for providing this compiled list & text):

[Laura Ación](https://twitter.com/_lacion_), [Marcela Alfaro](https://twitter.com/Fichulina), [Yanina Bellini](https://twitter.com/yabellini), [Juliana Benitez](https://twitter.com/July_Benitezs) (expert ornithologist!), [Elio Campitelli](https://twitter.com/d_olivaw), [Paola Corrales](https://twitter.com/PaobCorrales), [Florencia D'Andrea](https://twitter.com/cantoflor_87), [Natalia da Silva](https://twitter.com/pacocuak), [Priscilla Minotti](https://twitter.com/pmnatural); [Riva Quiroga](https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga), [Vilma Romero](https://twitter.com/vilsurr), [Gabriela Sandoval](https://twitter.com/GabySandovalM), [Heather Turner](https://twitter.com/HeathrTurnr); and the [LatinR Conference Community](https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf)!

These contributors are from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Perú, Uruguay and the UK, and belong to R-Ladies Chapters and R User Groups in these countries. The final picture was chosen for the vote of the broader LatinR Conference Community.

Here are some insights into the final design elements: 

- The bird species is the chingolo (*Zonotrichia capensis*) which was chosen because it seemed to be the bird that is native to many Latin American countries, and is also unique to Latin America. It was one of a number suggested by ornithologist [Juliana Benitez](@july_benitezs)!
- The chingolo is standing on a tilde ("~") branch, used in letter eñe (ñ) 
- The color bands on the tilde represent colors on flags for Latin American countries
- The shape of Latin America is represented on the bird’s chest
- The bright green background is a nod to the astonishing biodiversity in Latin America

#### AfricaR

The AfricaR BoF button was designed with suggestions and feedback from AfricaR community leaders [Shelmith Kariuki](https://twitter.com/Shel_Kariuki) and [Dennis Irorere](https://twitter.com/Denironyx). 

Some design elements for the AfricaR button: 

- The colors (orange, purple and black) are borrowed from (and inspired by) the existing [Africa R Users](https://twitter.com/AfricaRUsers) hex design
- The shape of the continent is in orange (and outlined by data points, with a ggplot-inspired background grid)
- The ostrich was suggested by Shelmith and Dennis as a representative bird

#### R-Ladies

The R-Ladies BoF button started with an idea from R-Ladies founder [Gabriela de Quiroz](https://twitter.com/gdequeiroz), who suggested a gull as a nod to both R-Ladies’ beginnings in San Francisco, and to this year’s conference location! 

With feedback from Gabriela and the R-Ladies leadership team including [Laura Ación](https://twitter.com/_lacion_) and [Erin LeDell](https://twitter.com/ledell), and RStudio’s [Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel](https://twitter.com/minebocek), the final design features the following elements:

- A flock (or colony) of gulls, species chosen because it’s common to San Francisco, where R-Ladies began!
- The gulls are riding an updraft of air together
- The purple-to-black gradient is inspired by the R-Ladies color scheme

#### The whole collection

This year, there were 24(!) different Birds of a Feather buttons. When we put them all together, here’s the flock for the 2020 conference (with more planned for next year):

We hope that everyone can find a bird that they relate to, and we look forward to meeting many of you at future RStudio Conference BoF sessions!

So, just one final question: **Which bird(s) are you?**
