## January

January was for family summer vacations, the [kickoff meetings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K4HDAvxk3MkKN2DCr_oYSx1lE73fDI8Ri1Bxo8z83ow/edit?usp=sharing) for the [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/), and the first rOpenSci [Community Call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/jan2023-targets/) of the year about the target package. I also developed the [training](https://ropensci-training.github.io/ropensci-mentors/) and [support material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFSxy02-OBf9zwz1Didi7J6Opz93UWIfTHtPEOWQLw/edit) for mentors for the Champions Program.

We say goodbye to my grandma. 

## February

February was for [VISA interviews](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-05-06-visa/), learning [Software Design by Example](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/) and [teaching for the rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/08/04/champions-program-training/).

I got renewed for another year as a [GitHub star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/yabellini/) thanks to the people in the community who nominated me.

I was [interviewed](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/02/28/happy-23rd-birthday-r) by the RConsortium to celebrate the 23 anniversary of the R language and delivered several talks [about rOpenSci](/talk/2023_torontoworkshopreproducibility/) to [other](/talk/2023_bioconductor/) [communities](/talk/2023_eurobioimaging/). It feels so good when other people find what you are doing useful. 

It was for grow our vegetables: bell peppers, tomatoes, squash, beans, basil, and mint.  And for reading [The Grieving Brain by Mary-Frances O’Connor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58007238-the-grieving-brain?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_13).

## March

My kids started their school, and I started teaching another round of my undergrad course on [Data Management](https://yabellini.netlify.app/courses/gestiondatos/) and Visualization for Data Science at the National University Guillermo Brown.

We have the [first version in Spanish](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/es/preface.es.html) of the [rOpenSci comprehensive guide to software development](https://devguide.ropensci.org/). 

It was also a month of restoring books, enjoying my new bookcase, and starting swimming - I completed 21000 meters. 

## April

[CSV,Conf](https://csvconf.com/2023/) came to South America and Buenos Aires for the first time. I was part of the organizing team.  I deliver the talk [Tell me who you hang out with, and I'll tell you who you are: a collaborative analysis using social network analysis](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/2023_csv_conf/). That my first talk in English at an in-person conference happened in Buenos Aires is ironic and hilarious.

We also have [The Carpentries Executive Council retreat](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/05/EC-retreat/) in Buenos Aires and the CZI’s Accelerating Open Science in Latin America meeting where I lead a working session on [How do you measure the impact of a champions program?](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/06/15/ropensci-champions-impact-en/). 

I met many incredible people in person at these three events! I cooked [empanadas](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=define%3A+empanadas&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) for some of them. 

R-Ladies Global Team [opened a call for volunteers to serve in multiple roles](https://www.rladies.org/news/2023-04-11-global-team-recruiting/) critical to the sustainable growth and maintenance of the organization

I read [Driftwood by Marie Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51600238-driftwood?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_23) and swam 10200 meters. 

## May

This month was for planning the second cohort of the [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/) and the [community calls](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/) for the rest of the year.

I was in an [panel as GitHub Star with Thomas Dohmke](/talk/2023_github/), GitHub’s CEO, at the University of Buenos Aires, and  [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) invited me to share a [talk about coding style and testing](/talk/2023_ols/) for their OLS-7 cohort.  

I enjoyed teaching [Developing Software Together: using Git](https://yabellini.netlify.app/courses/git-developing-software-together/) with Paola Corrales for the applicants of the rOpenSci Champions Program.

I also read [Lab Girl by Hope Jahren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733983-lab-girl?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_8), [Avatar Legacy](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender:_Legacy), [Nettle and Bone by T. Kingfisher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56179377-nettle-bone?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11), and I swam 20800 meters.

## June

June is for [remember Ana](/blog/2023-06-11-eleven/).

We have our community call [{targets} in Action](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/jan2023-targets/), and [I made some changes to our process to organize these community calls](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/2023_github_cscce/). rOpenSci [left X (former Twitter)](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/06/14/ropensci-communication-channels-en/). 

I collaborated on a [tip sheet that explores 12 guiding questions to help improve the accessibility of virtual events](https://www.cscce.org/2023/06/28/new-cscce-tip-sheet-highlights-12-guiding-questions-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-next-virtual-event/).

The book [DSxD Anthology Vol. 2. Our Environment. A collection of work by data designers, artists, and scientists](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-07-26-dsbyd/) was published! Natalia Morandeira and I wrote a chapter called [Multilingual Data Science. Ten Tips to Translate Science and Tech Content](http://datasciencebydesign.org/blog/multilingual-data-science). It is extraordinary to publish something you wrote with a friend.

Once again, I taught the Agro Big Data course in the Diploma of New Technologies in Agriculture at the Universidad de la Empresa in Uruguay.

I read [Turning Darkness into Light by Marie Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41555968-turning-darkness-into-light) and [Tales of the Unexpected by Roald Dahl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394689.Tales_of_the_Unexpected). 

I swam 20200 meters.


## July

It was a month of hard outreach work to share the call for the rOpeSci Champions Program. We featured our Champions and Mentors in a great [community call on Mentoring & training program for Scientific Open Source Champions](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/july2023-championprogram/). The Portuguese-speaking community [start translating our comprehensive software development guide](https://devdevguide.netlify.app/pt/maintenance_cheatsheet.pt).

I restarted my work on the [second edition and Spanish version of Teaching Tech Together](https://teachingtechtogether.netlify.app/). We created and taught a [12-hour training in Spanish based on the book](https://yabellini.netlify.app/courses/t3es/). 

I taught the Introduction to Data Science for Agriculture course of the [Latin American Diploma in AgroAnalitycs](https://www.uces.edu.ar/carreras-escuela-negocios/gestion-y-administracion/diplomado-agroanalytics) at UCES, Argentina.

I quit my teaching position at Universidad Nacional Guillermo Brown. We enjoyed the winter school holidays. No swimming in winter.  

## August

August was to learn how to swing butterfly style and swim 20800 meters. I was also to paint my kids' room wall with a monster city. 

I delivered [3 talks](https://yabellini.netlify.app/talk/page/2/), and I had a [nice chat with Data Umbrella’s about my experience in communities](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/yanina-community). 

We also organize two Social Coworking and Office Hours - Champions Program Application Clinic, and I have several 1:1 meetings to help people with their Champions Program application.

We start with onboarding the new member of the R-Ladies Global Team and offboarding some valuable members who have served the community for many years. This means we start using, adjusting and testing all the changes we made to our process.


## September


I attended [my first Posit Conf in person](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-12-11-posit-conf/ )!!! Sharing those days with the complete new R-Ladies’ Leadership Team (Shannon, Avery, Mo, and Riva) and one of the founders, Hannah Frik, was the icing on the cake. We held an [R-Ladies Meetup with R-Ladies Chicago](https://rladies.org/news/2023-10-09-positconf-chicago-meetup/) to close the conference. Another event were I had the opportunity to see many awesome people in person for the first time.

I joined the R-Ladies Mexico chapters to share [what we do at  rOpenSci](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fXtbMDMR-EGMszJvIp1uoJ4LxZ5hhuKNBQwYjVKbcoQ/edit?usp=sharing) and news about R-Ldies. 

I taught the [Application Seminar 1 on Reproducible reporting with R](https://yabellini.github.io/AgroReportesConR/), and the Application Seminar 2 on Agricultural Data Science for the AgroAnalytics Diploma of the Austral University, Argentina. 

I got the Emerging Leader Ascent certification by Lead Belay - thanks NUMFocus for this opportunity. 

I swam 17600 meters and crafted gifts for my friends - but not simultaneously. 

## October

October was for friendship and travels. 

I finally went to Toronto and spent five fabulous days with [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) and his family. I meet [Mike Hoye](https://github.com/mhoye), try a lot of new food, saw some of the autum colors, and cooked empanadas with Sadie.  I participated in a workshop to discuss how to publish live interactive papers, organized by the University of Toronto. 

After going back from Canada, my family and I traveled to Montevideo, Uruguay, to participate in [LatinR 2023](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-11-05-latinr-2023/). I was co-chair again. The event was trilingual. We got over 80 proposals for talks and posters and more than 300 attendees from 14 countries, with 48% identifying as female. I also saw and meet in person many many great people. 

My family returned to Argentina, but I traveled to Madrid for the rOpenSci in-person meeting. I meet the rest of my co-workers and we share very nice time together and think about rOpenSci future. It was very special for me to get to know [Maëlle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu) in person. We have known each other since 2017 because of R-Ladies, and it is fantastic to work with and learn from her. 

I moderated the [Latin America Highlight The Carpentries 25th Aniversary](https://hachyderm.io/@thecarpentries/111324211511136974) and Alycia Crall, Oscar Mansiyana and I published our [Mastodon Quick Start Guide](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10019853) to support everyone willing to move to Mastodon.

I organized the [R in Government comm call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/oct2023-government/), taught the Agroanalytics Application Seminar 3 on Remote Sensing and Modeling for The Austral University and reviewed [RConsortium ISC grant proposals](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/governance). 

October was also for reading [Guards, Guards by Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guards!_Guards!), and [The Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49867430-hench).

## November

First community call in Spanish for R-OpenSci !!  We have the first version of our translation and localization guidelines and R packages to support localizations. 

We wrapped up the project [The Stars of R-Universe](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/06/r-universe-stars-finale/): we interviewed five research groups actively developing R software about their goals, practices, struggles, and how they use r-universe.dev. I shared this project with my sister Alejandra Bellini.

The Master's Degree in Data Mining of the UTN Regional Rosario got CONEAU’s accreditation - I helped build this degree. I taught the Machine Learning course for the Latin American Agroanalytics Diplo at UCES.  

[R-Ladies leave X](https://rladies.org/news/2023-11-10-mastodon-meet-the-r-ladies/).

I attended Nova, xxx and I give a keynote at R Day Colombia.

I swam 16200 meters and had chocolate cake for my birthday. It was also for reading The Girls with All the Gift by M.R. Carey, The Final Girl Support Group by Grady Hendrix, and Paladin’s Grace by Kingfisher.
