This resource was first developed by attendees at the August 26, 2024 Chan Zuckerberg Initiative community call 
for the Essential Open Source Software program. 

Here are the 10 simple rules:

1. Establish and overcommunicate the project’s mission and vision.
2. Lead by example, both in doing the technical work and creating culture.
3. Align incentives for contribution and participation.
4. Create agency for your community members.
5. Intentionally build THIS group’s “culture”.
6. Foster inclusivity.
7. Empower others in the group.
8. Listen and adapt to develop contributor motivation.
9. Make it easy.
10. Expect and prepare for community turnover.

The full list with resources can be access on the [checklist webpage](https://eoss-om-communitycalls.github.io/2024-08-27-10-simple-rules-for-leadership/).
