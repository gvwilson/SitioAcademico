My list of plans for 2024, because dreaming does not cost anything:

* Finish updating Teaching Tech Together to have a second edition in Spanish and see if we can have it also in English.

* Have a first version of the other books I'm working on.

* Design and publish new training materials. 

* Teach for my communities and universities.

* Try write 100 blog post in a year. See https://100daystooffload.com for more details and #100DaysToOffload hashtag.

* Lose 10 kilos.

* Help my kids to accomplish their new year resolutions.

  - I'm very excited about this one: _Read aloud every day (one tale per day)._

* Organize LatinR 2024.

* Get funding for new rOpenSci Community Management ideas.

* Get funding for new R-Ladies ideas.

* Volunteer for The Carpentries. 

* Continue reading books in English and Spanish. 

* Try to accomplish New Year's resolutions from my swim coach to me (I think the nicest thing on the list is the level of faith my coach has in me):

    - Improve crawl (even though technique is very good I still need to adjust the stroke).

    - Increase speed in all the swimming styles.

    - Reach 3000m in one hour.

    - Participate in at least one competition.
    
Let's see how this goes.
