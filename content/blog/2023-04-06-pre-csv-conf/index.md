I enjoy organizing conferences, congresses, and events where people come together to share what they do.

As it is an activity that requires a lot of energy and continuous work, and I generally do it in my free time, this year I am participating in the organization of only two conferences (I have organized five confs in a year, so two is a pretty low number).

I would like to tell you about one of these conferences, the [CSV,Conf,v7](https://csvconf.com/)

## Color and mascot.

Let's talk about our color and our official mascot.

This year the conference is held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. April, 17-20 as an in-person event.

The red color was picked from Argentina's national flowers: Erythrina crista-galli, Kapot, or Ceibo.

Our mascot, the Comma Llama, was recreated by the awesome Sara Petti as a very cool *mate drinker llama.

> *mate is an infusion that is widely consumed in Argentina and other countries in the greater Chaco region of South America.

The mascot will also be present as miniature llamas woven with llama wool during the conference.  
Llamas are sourced from indigenous women communities from the Puna region of Catamarca province in Argentina.  Here are more info about the artisans communities:

- Antofagasta de las sierras: https://casadecatamarca.gob.ar/volcan-y-laguna-antofagasta/
- Santa Maria: https://casadecatamarca.gob.ar/fuerte-quemado/

Thanks to Marisa and Vera for making this happen. I bet you already want to take them with you. üòç ü¶ô

And you will also see Comma Llama giving us good tips on how to interact during the conference, for example, 

How to wear a mask correctly when participating indoors. üò∑

Or how to apply the Pacman rule to help people participate. ü¶ô

## Communities

We count on the work of many friendly communities.

On **Monday**, we have three workshops. 

### The Carpentries 

The Carpentries teaches researchers basic programming and data science skills worldwide. Since a few years ago, The Carpentries community has grown in Latin America, with several people certified as instructors & trainers.

In this free and in Spanish workshop, you can learn about the R language, Git, and The Carpentries and how to be part of it.

### Open Heroines Community Meeting

Open Heroines invites women and non-binary people to participate in a work meeting.

They will present the Open Gender Data Guide, co-created with the input of community members and targeted at grassroots organizations.

During the meeting, different authors¬¥ chapters will present their sections and the journey taken to produce the guide.  

We will also network and validate new projects for the second semester of the year.
