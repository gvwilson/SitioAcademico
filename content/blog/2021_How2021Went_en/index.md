Once again we come to the end of a complex year.  Reflecting on what happened is a way to improve in the future (or so I hope).  This is my summary of my highs of this 2021.


## Teaching

* I taught at two graduate programs - [Data science applied to public policies](https://www.unab.edu.ar/diplomatura-analisis-datos.html) at Guillermo Brown National University and [New technologies for agriculture](https://www.fca-ude.edu.uy/diploma-en-nuevas-tecnologias-para-la-agricultura.php) at Universidad de la Empresa (Uruguay) - and a [Data science](https://www.edn.org.ar/curso.php?center=cit&idcurso=NTYw) diploma. The courses are Big Data, [Visualization](https://diplodatosunab.github.io/visualizacion/) and Introduction to programming.

* I started teaching at the undergraduate level again.  It is [an undergraduate degree in Data Science](https://www.unab.edu.ar/lic-ciencia-datos.html) at Guillermo Brown National University.  The course is Data Management.

* I renew the [Creating interactive tutorials with {learnr} package](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/curso/learnr/) and co-create the [How to teach programming online](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/curso/programar/) for MetaDocencia.

* I taught 11 courses for [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/), including the two new courses I just mentioned.

* After an intense year of work, in May, we proudly announce that we have a stable version in Spanish of [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/).

* I taught my first [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/11/metadocencia-instructor-training-english/) for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) organized by MetaDocencia. Completely in Spanish and on-line.  The checkout percentage exceeded 80%.

* I took 66 exams for [RStudio certification](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) and certified 22 people as Tidyverse and/or Shiny instructors.  I am thankful for the opportunity to see so many different ways to teach and to solve problem using R.

* I was teaching assistant in Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel's course [What they forgot to teach you about teaching R](https://wtf-teach.netlify.app/) for the RStudio::global conference.

- I taught R in English for the first time with the course [From spreadsheets to R](https://yabellini.github.io/fromSpreadSheetToR/) as part of the [RS Camp: Beyond the Spreadsheet](https://www.software.ac.uk/programme-research-software-camp-beyond-spreadsheet) and MetaDocencia.

## Events

I was part of [53 events from January to December](https://yabellini.netlify.app/post/2021eventlist/), but I would like to highlight the following events: 

### Conferences

I was co-chair of useR! 2021, LatinR 2021, the 50 Argentine Conference of Informatic (JAIIO) and the 13th Congress of AgroInformatic.

- [useR! 2021](user2021.r-project.org/) was a global, accesible, inclusive and diverse on-line conference. I'm so proud of the organizing team and what we achieved. We had the largest participation in the history of the conference with _1800+ people and 120 countries_.  A _program committee and organizer_ with people from _4 continents_ and _each day of_ the conf _designed for different time zones_.   _Keynotes that ensured different dimensions of diversity_, with a _keynote_ in a language _other than English for the first time_.  _Accessibility thought from day one_. Content in _three languages_, _prices_ according to your _work status and country of residence_.  _Fee waivers and financial assistance_ to participate _without having to convince us why you needed it_. _Social events_ for first time attendees, yoga, trivia, draws, art gallery, communities meetings so you can have networking opportunities.
A beautiful job, with a wonderful team.  A conference that expanded what was possible to do in an event. A work that, I hope, will serve as a foundation for us to continue improving the conferences, so that less and less people are left out.

- [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/) was a success. Completely virtual. Two weeks. [Four tutorials (in Spanish and Portuguese)](https://github.com/LatinR/presentaciones-LatinR2021). [Two luxury guest talks (In English, one of them with subtitles in Spanish)](https://github.com/LatinR/presentaciones-LatinR2021) and [49 contributions](https://github.com/LatinR/presentaciones-LatinR2021#Contribuciones) in Spanish, Portuguese and English. We closed with an [inspiring panel of women scientists that developed packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgrjsk4XbYE&t=11711s).We broke our record with _1000 registrants_.

- The [50 JAIIO](http://49jaiio.sadio.org.ar/) were also virtual with 14 symposia and a student contest. +500 synchronous presentations were made on 3 YouTube channels ([Room 1](https://www.youtube.com/sadiosala1), [Room 2](https://www.youtube.com/sadiosala2), [Room 3](https://www.youtube.com/sadiosala3)). We have 10 keynotes, one for each day of the conference in Spanish and English. They were a success of participation during the 10 days of conference.

- The Agroinformatics Congress was held during 2 synchronous virtual days using Zoom + [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/sadiosala1) with 40+ trilingual presentations (Spanish, Portuguese and English) and 2 INTA's scientific as keynotes.


### Talks

- I gave __13 talks__, of which three of them were keynotes:

  * [Data Science Applications in the Agricultural Sector](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZKBddp3uoYXcAofMzBAmfgfWBTtYJCrXMzMd2BZrwA8/edit?usp=sharing) at the [X international seminar on applied statistics](https://congreso.see-ec.org/),  

  * [Teaching to teach without losing anyone along the way](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CSp-YjyoxMgQYU_cXJx-JVTvY0SOFfMblkJ4RBLfrCQ/edit?usp=sharing) at the [50 JAIIO](https://50jaiio.sadio.org.ar/) and 

  * [Data Science applied to Agriculture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZKBddp3uoYXcAofMzBAmfgfWBTtYJCrXMzMd2BZrwA8/edit?usp=sharing) at the Statistics Virtual Seminar "Big data and Data Science" in Colombia.  

- My [talk about education](https://resources.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/on-programming-teaching-and-building-interactive-tutorials-with-learnr/) at RStudio::global was special because __was the first talk in a language other than English__. I generated this [web page](https://learning-learnr.netlify.app/) for the talk.


## Communities

- MetaDocencia received a [two-year grant from CZI and fiscal sponsorship from CS&S](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/post/twoyeargrantcssczi/).

- I joined [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), first as an instructor, then as a trainer and now as a member of its [Executive Council](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/12/announcing-2022-executive-council/) elected by the community.

- The [R-Ladies Global](rladies.org/) Team is expanding and slowly resuming activities, we have been working hard behind the scenes, hopefully by 2022 we will be able to show some results.  As always the chapter organizers are the heart of the community.

- The R community in Latin America continues to grow, I have already talked about LatinR, RStudio certifications, the [participation of Latines at useR!](https://user2021.r-project.org/blog/2021/11/26/latines_at_user/) and [R-Ladies](https://yabellini.netlify.app/post/wsds_2021/).

- I was interviewed by María Nanton to add a personal history to the [Communication Chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/presentations/presentations-personal-stories.html?highlight=yanina) of the [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app)

- I have been invited to other communities but my participation is not as active as in these others I mentioned.  If you are not yet part of any community, I invite you to give them a try, they have changed my life in an extremely positive way.

## Health and family

last but not least, lets talk about health and family:

- My youngest son finished kindergarten and my little sister graduated with a degree in Communication Sciences (she is already a Radio and TV Broadcaster and Journalist).

- My son with a language impairment now reads stories to me.

- I had a hysterectomy in November after a year of struggling with fibroids. I'm recovering and everything is going really well.

- I finish another pandemic year without getting COVID-19 and without the need to get tested.  I have my 3 doses of the vaccine and my children have their two doses.  I feel very fortunate and completely aware of the privilege I have.


Finally, I answer the question I am often asked when reading these summaries:

> Yani, how do you do so many thing?.  Because I don't do it alone.

__This whole list of wonderful things that I am a part of are always, always, always carried forward and supported by talented and generous groups of people.  Groups that I am very fortunate to be a part of. No one can achieve so much alone. Beware of those who would have you believe otherwise.__
