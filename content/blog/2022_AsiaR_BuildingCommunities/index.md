On February 19 I participated in a panel called ["Building inclusive communities"](https://twitter.com/AsiaR_comm/status/1491916831522639876?s=20&t=eZl8e_Yn341iAaL05tms7w) Hosted by AsiaR


I shared the live panel with [Heather Turner](https://www.heatherturner.net/) and  [Iman Al Hasani](). [anani Ravi](http://www.talarify.co.za/About-Us/) and [Adithi R Upadhya](https://twitter.com/malvikaSharan) host the event and moderate the panel.


The idea of the panel was to share the experience of the growth of the R community in Latin America, so I made a time line with the last 5 years rescuing the most important milestones (of which I have been part as an organizer, as an assistant or enjoying them as a member of the community).

## Milestones in the R community in Latin America

{{< figure src="Diapositiva3.png" >}}

This journey starts in 2017 with R-Ladies, a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community. In 2017 the first actives chapters in Latin America were founded (mine was Santa Rosa and the second chapter in Argentina). Today, Latin American R-Ladies are almost 30% of the R-Ladies Global, with 59 chapters sharing the first place with the anglophone North America. I’m one of the R-Ladies Global and Leadership Team.

In late 2017, a group of R-Ladies and I started crafting LatinR, a Latin American conference about the use of R for research and development. LatinR will have its five edition this year, in hybrid format.

Given our familiarity with The Carpentries, we have workshops in LatinR and that make the community more know and more people from Latin America want to participate in this organization. Today Carpentries have more than 30 instructor, 4 trainers and I become a member of the Executive Council this year by the vote of the community.

The success of LatinR led one of its chairs to hold the first SatRday in Latin America in Spanish, and one year later, the first in Portuguese in Brazil.

In 2019 was also ConectaR, another conference celebrate in Costa Rica. 
LatinR is a trilingual conference in Spanish, Portuguese, and English because almost all Latin America speaks Spanish and Portuguese. However, in order to be on the map we need to speak English.

On the other hand, English is a barrier to Open Source and Open Science movements in Latin America. There are too few materials in local languages. This is why in 2018 we decided to collectively translate R for Data Science book in Spanish.

This include the translation of the package datos and a year later the translation of the same package to portuguese.  This allow us to have all the dataset used in the book in our language, becoming a great tool for teaching.

From the success of the collective and volunteer translation of R for Data Science, the community also got interested in translating Greg Wilson´s book Teaching Tech Together, which we translated in 2020.

The book is based on The Carpentries instructor training and was use on the RStudio Certification Program. In 2019 the first latin american person got certified. She is an R-Lady and was part of a study group we create to got the certification. I was part of that group and today I’m one of the examiner that certified RStudio Instructors.  This group study dynamic was replicated by MiR, another community that was born in the USA to help its members become certified.

Base in all the experience from R-Ladies, LatinR, The Carpentries and RStudio Education, R user groups drive by COVID19 I cofunded MetaDocencia (means MetaTeaching in English) and we teach how to teach and technical skill for free in Spanish around the world.

Other similar communities related to R and to provide material and trainig in Spanish were created in the region like R espacial (R spatial) and The bioinformatic developer community.

In 2020, as an event in LatinR, we organize the first ReproHack in Spanish. An event focused on trying to reproduce papers and give feedback to the authors.

{{< figure src="Diapositiva15.png" >}}

In 2020, in the LatinR Slack, come the idea to make a Survey for the Latin American R Community to know each other better.  One more time, a group of R-Ladies take the task and with the help of RForwards, conduct the survey that they present at useR!.

Finally, in 2021, RStudio Conf has the first talk in a language than English, was my talk in Spanish about interactive tutorials and useR! 2021 has the first keynote in another language than English, was a talk in Spanish about MetaDocencia. Last year I also ask in rOpenSci for the chance to send to review a package in Spanish and the community answer yes, and last year the first package in Spanish successfully passed the first review of rOpenSci.

## Some considerations

* R-Ladies is the driving force behind much of the community's progress.  In every event, group, translation, new community there are R-Ladies in decision-making, leadership and organizational positions.

* All of this is volunteer work so the most privileged people are those who are reached first.  Efforts must be made to reach other, more excluded groups.  Especially by meeting them where they are, going to their places and working with issues of interest to them.

* Sustainability is one of the greatest challenges.  Building a team that can take over and continue with the tasks when the founders need a break or move on to other activities.

* There is a lot of talent and potential in our regions.  Contact with international communities is an opportunity to make yourself known, to open doors and generate contacts for collaborations and professional opportunities.

* As language is often a barrier, translations are a very useful and low-barrier task to contribute.
