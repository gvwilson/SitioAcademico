I subscribe and enjoy reading newsletters.

*But only the right newsletters*.

(At the end of every year, I cancel the registration of those newsletters I don't read )

If you are at all interested in learning #RStats, here are the 3 most worth your time:

## **1. [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/)**

I enjoy the curated content, the focus on developing tools, and the podcast associated with the newsletter. In the podcast, I always learn from the insight and experience the host shares, videos, and conferences about the blog or packages they share. 

## **2. [What's New In R](https://rfortherestofus.com/whatsnew/)**

It is a weekly newsletter by R for the Rest of Us that highlights three resources to help you learn and use R. I have discovered nice tips that made me remember others. 

## **3. [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/news/)**

Our monthly newsletter features news and blog posts from the community and projects, as well as new packages, resources, and tools for R developers.
