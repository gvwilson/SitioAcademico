## Digital replacements of elements and face-to-face practices

During the pandemic I taught over 800 teachers how to teach online.

In those meetings many teachers said that it was difficult for them to emulate the face-to-face classroom in virtuality.  And many reflected that not having the experience of having been a student in an online classroom, they could not imagine how to be a teacher in that context.

In this last installment of *"Things that have gone wrong in virtual classrooms and how we solved them."* we are going to review tools and techniques for teaching on-line that can replace or *digitize* tools and techniques that we use in the classroom.

## Tools

- The blackboard is an important tool, in this blog post with Juan Domingo we tell you about it [how to use the blackboard in the virtual world](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2020_pizarron_virtual_es/),

- Sticky notes are a very useful resource for communicating with your students. in this blog post some ideas on how to have a sticky note board. [sticky notes teaching online](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2022_notas_adhesivas_es/)

- Here we write about [how to generate documents to have shared notes during on-line classes](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2020_documentoscompartidos_es/)

- A tool to generate diagrams on-line and collaboratively: [Exalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

### Working in groups

Group work is one of my students' favorite dynamics.  Here is a list of tips on details that can make your life easier when you have your students working together:

#### Questions to ask if you are not a host

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[EN] If you're using zoom to teach and they're working in small group rooms they won't be able to call you for help unless you're the host. If you're not, tell them to have someone from the group come back to the common room to get you when they need help.</p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1516424854542721031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

#### Time flies by

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[ES] When you teach online and do group work, set a timer xq el tiempo pasa lento para vos, pero para les estudiantes pasa volando<br><br>[EN] When you teach online and do group work, set a timer bc the time passes slowly for you, but for the students, passes in a heartbeat.</p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1516402137751826434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

When you design the exercises and make the calculation of how much time you are going to give them to solve them, you should always add more minutes:

- If this is the first exercise of the class:
  
  - add 2 to 3 minutes for them to enter the group room and get settled. One more minute if they have to select the room (instead of the teacher automatically sending them to one).
  
  - If this is also a new group, who do not know each other yet, then add 5 minutes and explicitly ask them to introduce themselves briefly at the beginning of the exercise.
  
  - If this is the first time they are working with group rooms, before starting the exercise explain how to enter and how to ask for help if they need it.
  
  If you are going to use a tool they have never used before, explain how to use it before starting the exercise.

It is very likely that in spite of these precautions, the first iterations of group work with new exercises you will run a little short of time.

#### See what happens in each group...without going in.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[EN] Look what Zoom has got! Now we can know what's going on in small group rooms. (also shows if someone is sharing screen)<br><br>[EN] Look what Zoom has! Now we can know what&#39;s going on in the small group rooms (also shows if someone is sharing screen). <a href="https://t.co/FRzExrmIIo">pic.twitter.com/FRzExrmIIo</a></p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1542993489071378432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

### Teaching programming

#### Pair programming

Here they use a lot of group work as well and since I teach R I use RStudio Cloud, but for other languages there are solutions like Colab.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Synchronous classes with Zoom in small groups where you visit them and they share the project screen in RStudioCloud. Incidentally you do pair programming.</p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1296109594553520128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

#### Live participatory programming

The idea is that students try to replicate what the teacher does, try to predict what is going to happen with the code, make mistakes and solve them together.  In the on-line format this activity is a bit more complex because of the size and availability of the screens and because we cannot get close to our students' computers and "look over their shoulders".

I modified the dynamics in this way:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In my experience, it is different if the students are beginners than if they are competent practitioners. Beginners are not going to code with you even if they have 3 screens.<br>What I do: live coding (15&#39;). breakout room, they code the same or very similar to what I do. Repeat.</p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1400051538584821769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

> Translation of tweet: *In my experience it makes a difference whether students are beginners or competent practitioners. Beginners are not going to code with you even if they have 3 screens. What I do: live coding). break room, they code the same or very similar to what I do. Repeat.*

Plus there are ways to be able to see your students' screen:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Synchronous classes with Zoom in small groups where you visit them and they share the project screen with you in RStudioCloud. Incidentally you do pair programming.</p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1296109594553520128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

and when a couple of classes have passed, your students are already encouraged to share their screen with the whole group, they even ask you for that possibility.

Other resources:

- In this article *Tony* explains [how to share live code with the world, from RStudio,](https://bitsandbricks.github.io/post/compartiendo-c%C3%B3digo-en-vivo-con-el-mundo-desde-rstudio/) with a solution that allows the audience, in real time, to see the teacher's activity on their own screen, copy and paste the code into their own session, and watch "live" as the explained code is deployed.

- The [interactive tutorials](https://learning-learnr.netlify.app/) are useful for use as labs and review of topics in synchronous classes and as asynchronous practice.

#### Exercises

Using GitHub or [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) for the delivery and correction of code exercises is a way to introduce Git, a complicated but very useful tool, early in our students' lives. We teach them using it by being part of the workflow and also teaching them the dynamics of code discussions and reviews.

## Life interferes with video calls

We have all shared our home during the pandemic.  That is why, although it is better to have some cameras on students to teach people and not little black squares, it should not be a mandatory requirement, we do not know where and how they are at that moment and we should respect their privacy.  This also applies to teachers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Teaching from home:<br>- <a href="https://twitter.com/romi_nahir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@romi_nahir</a> and Laura Belmonte, enter zoom with their daughters' names.<br>- Romi's daughter stops by to greet the students.<br>- I have a teaching assistant (you can tell she likes the radar course because she didn't miss any üòÖüòÇ) <a href="https://t.co/68mzMELlZG">pic.twitter.com/68mzMELlZG</a></p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1330914041112518657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

## The pedagogy of teaching on-line

When we started teaching on-line, without prior preparation and without warning, we teachers found ourselves having to learn how to teach in this context. Our students had *not only had to learn the content of our subject matter, but also how to study in the on-line environment (and from a pandemic)*.

We ask ourselves how to explain, how to get and keep their attention, how to evaluate, how to make sure they are doing well and learning, how to make sure we are doing well and can continue teaching.

There is a lot of new research on the subject and I hope to have the time to summarize it, but in the meantime I will share the book with you. [Teaching Technology in Community](https://educarencomunidad.tech/) where there is a lot of practical material on how to teach.

## Conclusion

Teaching on-line (and during a pandemic) is hard work and exhausting, but I still believe it is worth it.
