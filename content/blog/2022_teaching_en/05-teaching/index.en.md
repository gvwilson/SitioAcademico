Since we had to start teaching classes and doing online events we found a whole new world of possibilities of things that could go wrong or at least not as we expected.

The idea of this series is to share situations that occurred in classes and online events and how we solved them.

## First installment: infrastructure

Many of the situations and categories I am going to mention are related to the infrastructure available (connectivity and technological devices) for both the people who teach and the people who learn.

For example, in Argentina the population connected to Internet service does not reach 50% and only 10% of them have access to connections with the bandwidth and stability that allow access to classes and academic activities without difficulties. In addition, it is estimated that the technological park of devices, screens and printers available in Argentine households is 20 years behind (Orler and Lorenzo, 2021).

For this reason, we are going to start this series with an article where we will focus on the **electricity and the Internet**.

## 1\. The power is out!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Little things that happen when you organize an online conference from the middle of La Pampa in Argentina: the power goes out 20 minutes before the event, and you are the only one who can open the Zoom room.<br><br>(we already solved it, but seriously, what an awful feeling) <a href="https://t.co/Yg34VBn6Rp">pic.twitter.com/Yg34VBn6Rp</a></p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1579943230745251840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

> Translation of tweet: *Little things that happen when you organize an online conference from the middle of La Pampa in Argentina: the power goes out 20 minutes before the event, and you are the only one who can open the Zoom room.(we fixed it, but seriously, what a horrible feeling).*

This is something that happens often, sometimes they are **scheduled outages** for which one can:

- reschedule the event,

- move to a location that will not be affected by the outage (office, friend/parent's home, libraries), or

- teach with another person who can take care of you during the power outage.

But other times it's something **unexpected** Summer thunderstorms are very strong where I live, they usually happen at a moment's notice and usually generate power outages. It happened to me more than once, teaching and taking exams.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is not the worst, but it is what happened to me today: one of the people I admire the most invites me to be her TA, at the course time, the power goes out.<br>Solution: cell phone &amp; notebook with full battery.

> Tweet translation: *Not the worst, but this is what happened to me today: one of the people I admire the most invites me to be his assistant, at the time of the course, the power goes outSolution: cell phone and laptop with full battery. Activate the mobile wi-fi, connect the laptop to the mobile network.*

### Solution 1

For the case where we couldn't start zoom the light came back on time, but plan B was **to use another platform** In this case JitSi. The new coordinates were sent by **mail to all the people registered to the event** and the change of platform was announced by social networks (because it was a conference). In the case of a class in addition to the mail you can give a notice on campus and ask in the mail to please share it in the telegram group or similar about the change so that everyone knows about it. In addition, more time is given to be able to arrive, at least five minutes longer than usual to start the lesson.

For the exam it was enough to connect to Zoom via my cell phone and use cellular data to connect to the Internet.  It works very well for 30-50 minute meetings.  For longer meetings there are three problems:

- The cell phone often gets too hot and shuts down. Solution: I have a gel that freezes in the refrigerator, I wrap it with a cloth and support the cell phone.

- If the battery is not full, it may run out before the meeting.

- Your data package is consumed quickly and if you have an open plan, the bill for the month is going to be hefty.

### Solution 2

For the course, which lasted between two and three hours, I used my notebook and my cell phone.  Both with a full battery. I activated the mobile wi-fi on my phone and connected the computer to the mobile network provided by my cell phone (sometimes you have to connect the cell phone and the computer using Bluetooth), with this I had internet from my machine and I was able to teach as usual.

In this case the cell phone does not raise the temperature, but spends your data package anyway.

## 2\. Hello?...can you see me?...can you hear me?....

Connectivity problems have a wide range, from the Internet being down to being unstable and then we miss part of what is going on during class or cannot fully participate. It is a problem that happens often, especially in rural areas like the one I live in.

From a teacher's point of view, the biggest problem is leaving the class unexpectedly, leaving your students not knowing what happened and what to do.

### Solutions:

1. Always a good idea **to have the cell phone and computers fully charged.** before starting synchronous on-line classes. This way, we can use the solutions we already mentioned: if our computer and phone have battery power, we can continue the class using the cellular data.

2. Do not give the class alone, so the other teacher can continue (note in this case: try to make sure that the people who are giving the same class are not in the same class). *not* are not in the same physical location)

3. Have clear rules about what to do if the outage occurs (for both teachers and students), e.g.: tell them if we disconnect. **we will always return to the same link**.

4. Having a **alternative channel of communication**: mail, slack, discord, telegram, virtual campus forum and any other platform where you can let them know what happened, if you are coming back to the class or it is no longer possible, etc.  This can be with your co-teacher and/or with your students.

5. In case it is no longer possible to return to the meeting or make up the class at another time, you can. *share a recording of a previous class* of that subject.  In case it is a student who is unable to return, let them know at the beginning if the class is recorded so they know they will have an opportunity to view the lesson. *Remember to always ask for permission to record the lesson and then post it*

6. If you are teaching alone, ask your students to let you know if you can't hear or can't hear well. Cameras can be turned off to reduce bandwidth consumption.

7. Provide a summary of the information provided from time to time for people who may have been cut off from the Internet.  Re-share access to the shared class document and slides or other material they are using (and post these accesses on campus as well) so that those who have been disconnected at some point have access to all the class material.

## Plan

The general advice is to **think about what difficulties we might face and plan a plan B for each of these options.**.

Due to these three years of mandatory on-line teaching/learning experience we have more experience and tools to deal with them. I hope that sharing this kind of information will make it easier to think through the difficulties and plan how to solve them.

And you, did you have situations like the ones mentioned above while teaching or taking a class, how did you solve them?
