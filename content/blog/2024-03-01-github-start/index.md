Yesterday I got the email from GitHub that renew my status as a GitHub Star for third year. The text of the email said:


> Congrats, Yanina! We’re thrilled to let you know that you have been chosen to be a **GitHub Star for 2024**. Thank you for all your continued work and dedication to supporting and influencing the entire GitHub community over the past 12 months!

> You are one of around **100 amazing GitHub Stars selected from the community of over 100+ million developers** on GitHub! From creating content to giving us feedback to educating and sharing with your communities as they grow, you've played a tremendous role in helping users keep up with the rapid pace of change. You’ve been a shining light in what has continued to be a difficult year for many. Thank you for your passion to inspire, educate, and grow the community. ❤️

I am very grateful to the people in the R community who originally nominated me and for all the communities that I am part of that allow me to do this work of bringing coding and open science to more people around the world.
