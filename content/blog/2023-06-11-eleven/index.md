Eleven years ago, I became pregnant for the first time. It was a desired and wanted pregnancy.

It was also a delayed pregnancy because I wanted to fulfill a couple of dreams before becoming a mother. I knew my life would change forever when I had a child, although I never imagined it would change how it did.


In June 2012, Ana, my first daughter, was born, and today, also 11 years ago, Ana died.

The pregnancy was complicated from the beginning, I was in and out of the hospital for the five months it lasted, taking every measure to carry the pregnancy to term.  But we couldn't.  Ana was an extremely premature baby. Her chances of living were almost nonexistent, yet she lived a few days -- I like to think that she inherited that defiance towards what she was supposed to be able to achieve from me.

**I always think of that story by Galeano and I think that in my case, for a brief moment, not only God existed and was not deaf, but that he answered me yes and complied. He gave me all the pain he had reserved for her.**
