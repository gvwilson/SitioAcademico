Today we celebrate university professors in Argentina. The date made me reflect on why I teach. 
I will share my journey and the driving forces behind my passion for teaching computer skills.

Growing up in a small town in rural Argentina, I was lucky enough to have access to a computer at my elementary school. 
From the moment I saw it at the age of six, I knew that this was something special, and it sparked a love for computers and 
coding that has stayed with me throughout my life.

Despite facing many challenges along the way, thanks to the support of my family, I never stopped pursuing 
my passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge about computers and programming with others.

For me, __teaching is a way of empowering others__, a way to help them to learn, grow, and achieve their full potential. 
It's about helping people discover the joy of learning, the thrill of solving a problem, and the satisfaction of mastering a new skill.

Over the years, I've taught children, teenagers, and adults from diverse backgrounds in formal and informal settings. 
Through my teaching journey, I have been fortunate to connect with like-minded individuals and co-found and help develop 
communities that foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration where people can help each other improve. 
In addition, I've worked with universities and organizations worldwide to create open, free, accessible resources 
that can positively impact others' lives.

__I teach because education can transform lives__-- it certainly transformed mine. 
It's about help to acquire the power to change our lives and the lives of those around us. 
It’s about gaining a power that no one can take away from you once you have it. 
A power that multiplies the more you use it, the more you share.
 
That's why I teach – __to share my power with others. To give back__, so others can have the opportunity to choose.

__I invite you to do the same__. 

Whether you're an experienced educator, a student, or an enthusiast, your knowledge is valuable. 
We can make a difference in the world. By teaching, we will impact lives – not just the lives of those we teach, but our own lives as well.

_Happy professor day to all who choose to share your power!_
