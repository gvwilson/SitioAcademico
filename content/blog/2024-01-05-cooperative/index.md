A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to form a democratic organization whose administration and management are carried out in the manner agreed upon by the members.[^1]. Cooperative businesses are typically more productive and economically resilient than many other and frequently have social goals, which they aim to accomplish by investing a proportion of trading profits back into their communities. 
There are a number of principles and values:

- Voluntary and open membership
- Democratic member control, with each member having one vote.
- Economic participation by members
- Autonomy and independence
- Education, training and information
- Cooperation among cooperatives
- Concern for community

**Almost everything is run by a cooperative in my province.** The idea and concepts of cooperativism are part of the curriculum in elementary school and is a one-year course in high school.  There are complete high school orientations where the student receives a technical degree in cooperative management. In every town in La Pampa there is a cooperative that manages basic and important services. Because they are managed by a cooperative they are also accessible to all people living in that town.


I am part of three large cooperatives:

1.  [Housing cooperative:](https://www.coopvivienda.com.ar/informacion.html) we build houses and apartments. The cost is much lower than a private company, and the quality is higher. Many of our members do not qualify for a bank loan.

2. Santa Rosa Public Works and Services Popular Electricity Cooperative: manage electricity, street light, internet, television, and telephony for the whole city. It also has funeral services, a nursery, a library, and a sale of household appliances.

Every town in my province has a cooperative that manages these services; some add water purification.

We have some of the lowest costs in the country for these services.

3\) La Coope: a supermarket with reasonable prices that gives its members their share of the profits in the form of credit for our purchases every year.

In other parts of the country, there are banks and factories.

I can't imagine these services being handled any other way or that anyone would allow this form of government to be changed.

It is a successful and possible business model, beneficial for the whole community because it has the people and the community as their focus.
