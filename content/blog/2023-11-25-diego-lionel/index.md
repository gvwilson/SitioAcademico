Today someone asks me _Maradona or Messi_.
I say both. I will explain why:

* _El Diego_ taught us that no matter your origin you can become the best in the world at what you do.

* _Lionel_ taught us that even if you are the best in the world sometimes you will have to try many times before you succeed.

And they both made us world champions and showered us with happiness.

After sharing the above explanation a friend whom I love very much told me that when asked the question Maradona or Messi, the answer is neither.

And I forgive him because he is a very good friend. 

For all the people who love soccer, here is one of the most beautiful soccer stories, read by one of the best story readers in Argentina.

In Spanish. Enjoy.

“Me van a tener que disculpar” by Eduardo Sacheri read by Alejandro Apo. Soccer reporter Victor Hugo Morales.
