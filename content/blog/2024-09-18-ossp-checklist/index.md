This resource was first developed by attendees at the July 29, 2024 Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative community call for the Essential Open Source Software program. 

This resource is intended to be a conversation-starter for open source software project leaders, their collaborators, staff, and community. We know that some of these items are substantial, resource-heavy requests for an open science community and we donâ€™t intend that this is a comprehensive list of topics, nor a limiting one. 

The check list include this topics:

* Fundraising
  - Organizational Structure
  - Bylaws, Legal, and Tax Considerations
* Developing and Maintaining the Project
  - Managing Contribution
  - Planning for the future of your project
* Marketing the Project
  - Communications plan
  - Documentation
  - Marketing
* Managing the Project at Scale
  - Community Roles
  - Scoping
  - Governance
  - Community Health
  - Individual Growth
  
The full list with resources can be access on the [checklist webpage](https://eoss-om-communitycalls.github.io/2024-07-29-managing-an-oss-project/).
