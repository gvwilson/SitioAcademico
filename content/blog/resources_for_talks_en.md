During 2020 I prepared my talk for RStudioConf Global 2021. What a trip! In this post I share a series of useful, open and/or free resources used during the process to assemble the slides, record and edit videos and images.

## Videos

One of the activities to prepare classes or talks is the recording and editing of videos, here are some tools that I use to carry out this activity:

### To record yourself speaking and record the screen

* OBS Studio: https://obsproject.com/es/download

* Zoom: https://zoom.us/

* QuickTime Player: https://support.apple.com/es_ES/downloads/quicktime

* Xbox App (windows): https://www.xbox.com/es-AR/apps/xbox-app-for-windows-10

### To edit

* OpenShot: https://openshot.org/es/download/


## Pictures

### To edit

* GIMP: https://gimp.org

* Glimpse: https://glimpse-editor.github.io/

* Photopea (on-line): https://photopea.com

* Inkspace: https://inkscape.org/es/

## Another resources

### Teleprompter

If you need to read a script while giving your talk or recording your video, a teleprompter can be a very good help:

### Caption

Generating the subtitles of our videos increases their accessibility. YouTube generates the subtitles in our language automatically. We can use those subtitles to edit and translate them to another language.

We need to load the video on our YouTube channel and enter in the subtitles menu. The caption will be generated automatically when we assign the language of the video. You have to review them because depending on your accent the subtitles can have mistakes, for example, the names of people and places or words in English are always wrongly transcribed in my videos.
