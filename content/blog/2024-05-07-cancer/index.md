Talking hurts

Eating hurts 

Laughing hurts

Dancing (don't judge me) hurts

It hurts because, on May 2nd, I had surgery to remove my thyroid cancer. The prognosis is excellent. I'm still recovering, awaiting results & further tests. 

I have wonderful family, friends, and colleagues who are supporting me.

Reading & writing, fortunately, don't hurt. So I will be around.
 
Imagine how I am that I can't talk, eat, laugh and dance as much as I want to!
