Prompted by a question about how to use videos in your classes, a pot about how I have used it:

1. **Use case analysis:** after explain new concepts I split students into small groups for an exercise where they have to watch a video together and answer questions that lead the discussion  (in a shared doc per group). Then they go back to the common room and I ask each group to share their answer to different questions.  We all discuss together. I may repeat this several times. 

2. **Summarize a lesson:** The last part of the lesson, the whole class watches a video together, I stop the video at certain parts so that we can reflect on what we saw.  I have questions or comments prepared to guide the discussion and tie in what we learn in class with what we are watching in the video. 

3. **To practice a skill:** when we teach how to use a rubric, we make you watch a video and you should use the rubric to give feedback or evaluate what you saw.   

I used this for short workshops on informal and formal settings, for log-semester university courses, for invited classes.

I used this tools also for evaluation: as formative assessment and as part of summative assessment.

For online classess [here is an example in English](https://ropensci-training.github.io/ropensci-mentors/instructor_notes.html#mentor-tools.-grow-model) to watch a video of a person applying the GROW model in a meeting with another person that comes for help. This is [another example (in Spanish)](https://yabellini.github.io/gestiondedatos/clase1.html#ejercicios). The students have to watch a series of 3 videos that last 2 minutes, discuss and answer a seirries of question about Data Science.
