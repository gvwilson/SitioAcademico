Last year I participated in a series of tools trials conducted by CSCCE presenting how rOpenSci use GitHub to plan community calls. The tool trial consisted of several live webinars with Q&A session. After the events we were invited to write a series of tip sheets with the case we presented.

This is the [link to Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12117430) of the post I co-autored with the case study that outlines how rOpenSci uses GitHub to crowdsource ideas for community calls and, once approved, manage the planning of those calls internally.


* How do you solicit ideas for your community calls? 

* What tools do you use to manage planning of your community calls?
