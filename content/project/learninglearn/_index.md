This project was born in 2019 when I started using the `{learnr}` package, from the R programming language, to generate interactive tutorials based on *rmarkdown* documents.

This website has resources _in Spanish_ about `{learnr}` that I generate periodically with the idea of sharing my learnings, my successes, my mistakes, my own tutorials and materials that I consider interesting for those who also develop this type of teaching resources.

Interactive tutorials are very useful for remote, in-person, synchronous or asynchronous classes and as help to an R package.

The web was the extra material for my regular talk [On programming, teaching, and building interactive tutorials with learnr](https://resources.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/on-programming-teaching-and-building- interactive-tutorials-with-learnr /) at _RStudio::global 2021_, an international conference about R organize by the company RStudio.
