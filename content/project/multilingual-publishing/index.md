## Overview

The "Multilingual Publishing" project is an initiative by rOpenSci to expand the accessibility and reach of scientific knowledge by translating essential materials on best practices for software development, code review, and contribution to open source projects into Spanish. This effort aims to lower language barriers and make valuable resources available to a broader audience, thus fostering a more inclusive scientific community.

## Goals

- Translate rOpenSci's materials into Spanish to make them accessible to Spanish-speaking communities.
- Develop guidelines and tools for translating open source resources to facilitate further translations into other languages.
- Promote the inclusion and participation of non-English speakers in the scientific and open source communities.

## Outcomes

- A set of translated materials available on rOpenSci's website, including guidelines for software development and code review.
- Tools and guidelines developed for the community to engage in translation efforts, contributing to the multilingual expansion of scientific resources.
